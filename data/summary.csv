0,Julia Fox is yet another female celebrity promoting her new Memoir it's called down the drain I guess that's where Kanye's urine went right down no it went it went into the to the onto the wall so in this Memoir she details the Romantic encounter in which they first met and it has a pee incident okay I'm sorry but I need to tell you this is the first night they met she calls him the artist by the way she doesn't name him in the Memoir she's just you know gesturing toward who it might be the artist starts peeing on the wall and I quickly jump in front of him before telling people outside the club not to take any pictures this is her Valiant moment where she's literally the Secret Service of Pee She Shields him from the paparazzi getting getting the pee photos she jumps in front of a man who's peeing well the funniest part in front of in front of him like he's in a dark alley she's covering the alley so that no one can see him it's actually really romantic if you think about it no then he gets done he's like I wanted them to take that photo I was trying to make it controversial what are you doing and then it says once he Zips his pants back up he puts his arms around me and pulls me in close kissing me passionately bro didn't even wash his hands first that was like all the comments uh on the videos I start talking about this were debating about like the why did people feel so strongly about this specific account no idea they were veryable he peed in it out that's like the worst thing ever and it's just like bro like if if you're a dude who's gotten drunk at a bar it's likely I'm not like grossed out by him I'm grossed out by her that she wasn't grossed out by it that she's acting like this is like a huge romantic moment between her and a lover it's like you're a gold digger who tried to like get on yeah get he put his hands on her face and Whitney and Whitney Houston's I will always love you just played from inside the inside the bar right at that Crescendo moment I think she you're kind of right that she's a bit of a goal Digger but it's more an opportunity Digger cuz she was saying in this Memoir she wasn't really that into Kanye she was into the opportunities that he might be able to give her if she stays with him despite not really liking him that much um and I think she is doing what his current wife Bianca sorri might do eventually which is turning on him and making him the villain in the story of their relationship she says now that she was simply being used as a pawn in his Grandmaster plan to get back at his ex-wife that's humiliating that's a really shitty position to be in and she also called Kanye a master gaslighter uh essentially accusing him of being abusive without actually saying that M which just seems uh misleading and opportunistic yeah she's like playing the victim card now cuz she's lost opportunities for having dated Kanye at this point since his reputation has gone downhill she's now she's associated with him she's kind of canceled by association and she has to distance herself do you remember this article from 20202 that says Julia fox said she dated Kanye West to get him off Kim Kardashian's case and distract him that's what she said I thought ultimately I'd be helping a precarious situation oh shut up but I learned very quickly that I was being weaponized I felt like his little puppet I feel like he's using me in some weird Twisted game and it makes me feel dirty it's funny cuz she admits to using him yeah they used each other they used each other right exactly so who's the victim nobody no no the by by the modern day Progressive law of power dynamics she's a woman so she's dumb and stupid that's that's literally what they're saying they're like she he's got he's got M more Fame and more wealth than her and she's a woman so she's dumb that's that's literally what they're saying she can't handle his master gaslighting so like it's always funny whenever like people kind of horseshoe around to like uh we we want to help women so much that we're going to pretend like they're invalids which is what they're saying they don't know any better that's what they're saying about Bianca Sor right now the more accurate representation and the more the more empowering situation would say they know exactly what they're doing and even if you disagree with having a transactional relationship with a person as a fully grown big girl adult she's allowed to do that and get whatever she wants out of that relationship because sometimes life isn't as simple is falling in love like a Disney movie especially if you're a disgusting celebrity who's just out to turn every interaction with another human being in your favor y yeah it's it's an insult to women to treat them like children I think that what Bianca sinor is doing with her life right now um is degrading but I think she's doing it on Purp purpose and she doesn't need anyone to save her she's going to learn the consequences of her own actions the way any adult should MH um she also Julia Fox revealed that Kanye offered to get her a boob job while playing Uno about like two weeks into knowing each other we were spending a day playing Uno in a game that involves highlighting positive words in the dictionary what is this kindergarten I'll get you and sine came up Kanye offered a yeah Kanye had given her a a top that she said it doesn't look good unless she wears a bra and then he said I'll get you a boob job if you want ah the romance she said no thanks uh and then she said she said it made her uncomfortable okay that's a bit of a loaded word um he was just offering but um I don't know he was just being a nice guy I would a little offended but I don't know he thinks every chick wants a boob job proba somebody thought it was interesting given that his mom died of plastic surgery oh yeah he was trying to kill her is that what that's not what they said but yeah they said it was interesting they like thought you thought he would be more sensitive to the issue given that his mom died undergoing cosmetic surer he seems to never learn from his mistakes right because it's like they what we love about him yeah like I mean it's almost like a innocence kind of thing in a way but which I actually I don't think it is at all but it's like he keeps dating these women and then acting shocked that they only like him for his resources Fame and money and doesn't understand why they keep like leaving him and betraying him and WR these hit pieces or Memoirs actually you know whatever you call them now so I I don't feel bad for him or her I think he almost certainly was using this public relationship to do what he thinks is getting back at Kim Kardashian when in reality he was just making himself look worse and making her look like the bigger person she just turned into Super Dad and just become dad of the year who just did like everything for the kids all the time and just make her look like a a greedy work work obsessed like that would have worked narcissis it would have worked for him yeah but I I guess their breakup amounted to um Kanye soft ghosting Julia Fox because he got on a phone call with Kim Kardashian where he learned he was so shocked to learn that Julia Fox had had addiction issues in the past and he's like well that's just a bridge too far and Julia said uh I already told you that I had been on drugs before you just weren't listening she she does mention a thing there's even like funny he doesn't vet these women at all yeah so well they're talking and he just he's just bring he's like yeah yeah you're you know you're really smart people underestimate you there was the thing where she said like when when he called like he would mostly talk and I would mostly listen and I laugh cuz it's like of course right he's the Mad genius uh and you're the and you're the the new woman in his life and but she said but when he when I did talk he said yeah all of my points were very interesting and I was very intelligent so he he sprinkled on the compliments as much as he could muster he's like wait like he he probably pays a guy to like stand like awkwardly in the Next Room and listen to what he said what she said and then like write a synopsis that he can read later right it's like she thinks he was she was his Muse but really it was just him thinking about himself the entire time literally any woman should just sat there she is most known for that clip of her being like I was Josh saf's M in on Cut jams on Cut Js I just um she also says her Memoir didn't detail intimate moments with Kanye because their bond was essentially sexless quote it wasn't really about that she she claims that they never had sex interesting honestly I I would believe that I would believe that yeah cuz if it is advantageous to claim that you did you know she would MH right doesn't really make a difference at that point she was waiting for that so she could add the part in the Memoir about how he was sexually aggressive but she can't because they didn't have sex yeah exactly also by the time that they stopped talking Kanye sent her at NDA and said if you don't sign this NDA we can't be friends anymore and she said I'll live boundaries he's got boundaries he also sent ndas to her friends it is kind of obnoxious that she kind of expected him to hire her friends as an Entourage of stylists like he told her that one of the things that bothers him about her is that she constantly brings her friends to everything they do have you ever seen that like Tik Tok where the girl shows up to like a date with a guy with like a friend and then and then gets mad when the guy like leaves he's like I'm not kind of like that yeah yeah but he did end up you know employing her friends I'm sorry but it's really funny he put her friends on the payroll it's really funny that if millionaire Kanye West like they come to dinner and he makes like he just splits the check he like he makes like he's like I'll pay for you but I'm not paying for your friends there was that other video where like a guy uh took his girlfriend out for for dinner over uh like for her birthday and she brought like all her friends and family and he's like I'm not paying for all of these people didn't she get mad about that yeah she got really mad about that the girl will be like whatever happened to chivalry yeah no really that's literally what would happen you invite the neighbors like your dog walker the mailman everything you know it's it's a scam it's a scam kind of tired of self-interested professional adult women getting into relationships that are essentially transactional and then acting like they're victims after the facts exactly if you want to be in a transactional relationship that's fine but just be honest about the fact that's what you want she didn't get the prize that she wanted at the end because of the fact that Kanye blew up his reputation after the fact she didn't get the cred the street cred in her industry that she thought she would get so when she realized she took the wrong Gamble she wants to turn it around and make it out like he was the bad guy she's like now I have to start this stupid podcast to talk to these stupid celebrities she putting out a mem she's she has the podcast she's doing also a reality show that's kind of like Project Runway she's kind of perfect for that to be honest like in the 2000s this is exactly the type of person who would have ended up on a reality show with a reality show she's she's perfect for that that's like right on his reputation didn't hurt her at all in my opinion yeah she's still able to get away like Scots free and play the victim card and is still getting all these opportunities how do you guys do you guys feel that he's um controlling his uh his new wife oh probably most likely they are legally married now yeah we were wrong about that they are legally married they are they're not married they are they're legally married at this point yeah I don't know for me personally no amount of money would be worth that but uh it's not if every not even if he puts all your friends and family on the payroll I mean she was already on the payroll before they were even dating she was an employee of his family right now was like come on Sarah I don't know what it means that she was his architect for for Yeezy but yeah that's how they met kind of like how Elon meets his baby mamas he's got well those work those workplace things it's just it's it's can be can be dangerous if you're if you're Elon but elon's also such a Droid that it's like it doesn't even matter like there's not really much emotional it doesn't feel like like I I wonder what emotions like do does Does Elon Musk have emotional emot fraught conversations with Grimes or does he just she's like I'm mad at you he's like what are you mad about well there was that time that Elon posted a tweet saying like pronouns are stupid or something and then Grimes replied I know this isn't your heart call me oh my god oh by the way I have a new i' I've added another phrase to my list of things that don't mean anything and I think more than any more than any phrase out of all of them my heart is so full makes me angrier than anything it's like I get it you're at a wedding I really do hate that now that you mention it I didn't even realize that that was the phrase that like triggers me but yeah my heart is so wasn't there another one that like triggered you nourishing my body I hate nourishing I hate I hate the word nourishing in general but yeah nourishing my body is I have a list it's I unfortunately like oh yeah stepping into my comments that's what I hate stepping into my comments I hate that one it's for a lot of it is like a bunch of a bunch of these got deleted off my off my list of anything involving my truth taking back my happiness be kind I know you don't like be kind that's because it's a morphous it doesn't mean anything it's like uh it's like nobody's meaner than a person who has be kind in their profile they are the meanest people on on Earth you see it on school like there's like a there's a school out here that just has it like on the fence of the of the baseball stadium I also really don't like be yourself that was the ubiquitous phrase for children of the 2000s be yourself I don't even know what that means taking back my happiness what I'm re reclaiming reclaiming my happiness yeah you took a creative writing class great I hate congrats I hate all of that it's just it's like say like I'm happy now that's way easier it's just get off Instagram those are all Instagram phrases right literally if you if you made an it's like I'm going to make an inspirational infographic app and it just has like word like phrase suggestions now I need to like air my grievances about this new season of Love is Blind because you can really easily tell that all of the women on the show are normies who don't think any deeper than Instagram quotes about self-love like every I forgot about okay especially the woman from Puerto Rico that Dane claims he used to know she's one of the worst first and she's like I'm perfect I'm I'm so emotionally mature and I have it all together and I just need to find someone who deserves me like this is the language of the dating world right now also all of the women show up like thoughts that are like going out to a night in the club and the men are dressed up for like job interviews like it doesn't make sense men should just start turning the tables and doing that where they just show up with like barbecue sauce shirt like half the shirt is tucked in half the shirt isn't I need a woman who can handle all of this no these men are dressing up for dates where the women can't see them I mean granted they're on TV so a lot of people are going to see them but still yeah most of the women were just like touting self-love phrases like I'm ready to date because I finally have accepted myself and learned to love myself and I've been in I've been in bad had relationships before because I didn't love myself and all of the men were evil toxic narcissists you were never the it's like it is Taylor Swift syndrome if you've dated 33 guys and they will sabotage their own relationships and then blame the guy or self-pity about it afterwards like this one girl was on the verge of getting proposed to by this guy and decided to finally drop this bomb of information on him that she has been divorced like on one of their like they're pretty far along in the process and then she's like by the way I got divorced is that okay with you and he's like uh no and then she goes to throw a pity party about it like he doesn't accept me for me well there isn't really a thing that a woman could a woman could literally be like look I went to jail for murder in the 80s and and then and then she she like that's okay right and the guy would be like no that's not okay I don't date women who have been uh who have been uh you know in prison for murder I guess just insecure thanks for watching listen to full

2,about what's going on over at Warner Brothers uh and the fact that they could be selling to Universal in the next couple of years which is very very interesting considering they just got sold from AT&T to Discovery like less than a year ago I didn't even know that AT&T owned Warner Brothers before that right so what's what's interesting to me about this is like look they can't win we've watched them release project after project in the last year uh and they can't seem to find a footing for anything that works none of the DC movies have really done all that well they're not really doing anything with Harry Potter outside of the theme parks until the new television show comes around but Universal which is owned by Comcast has had nothing but success stories this year so they did Oppenheimer Fast and the Furious um Super Mario Brothers yes uh as well as cocaine bear in Five Nights at Freddy's is about to come out and we were having trouble finding tickets for Five Nights at Freddy's because all the seats were sold outs know what sells also Puss in Boots The Last Wish uh and what's interesting like like people mention like how how much money Barbie made with all of this press and all of this like media fervor Super Mario Brothers almost beat like they they barely beat Super Mario Brothers and they did it without any of less marketing way way less marketing but also way less buzz from like us talking about it right it just proves the strength of the brand for them uh and so Comcast is is at this time the largest media conglomerate in the United States it's like number one next to I think um I had the list it owns the rest of Hulu that Disney doesn't own exactly right so uh like Comcast AT&T Disney Paramount Global and then Warner Brothers Discovery are the are the companies that are the biggest media conglomerates in in America but Comcast also owns um Universal or I'm sorry they own sci-fi Universal CNBC MSNBC uh and then also the Universal Parks which is like that's a lot of stuff to own so one of the things you have to worry about is like look it's going to end up you're consolidating down so far that only a small number of companies own any of these businesses and why would you want to sell the company why would why would um Warner Brothers want to sell right now when it would be at a loss because they haven't been able to bolster their numbers or cut enough weight from their from their books well in this article it says it's because uh Warner Brothers is broke AF right now so it's a last ditch effort and this is why David zaslav demanded that James gun recast DC with cheaper Talent like David Corn sweat uh as Superman the plan for the original The Flash movie uh was not what we saw they were saying it was going to have a bunch of cameos and set up for movies with Henry caval with Ben Affleck like all all the favorites and then they had to change it last minute and it was not what they envisioned at all and what's funny about like if you look at the biggest companies in the world it's Apple Saudi oil and Microsoft oh my God right so there's also talks like they they assume that there's a lot of people that assume that at some point apple is just this enormous Corporation that's going to eventually buy up one of these companies likely Paramount at some point the Lend like it's very possible they could because they have the money their own streaming service is not doing so hot but the thing is they they're kind of insulated the way Amazon is right the the the market cap on on Apple is $2.7 trillion so it's like they have the the cash Reser you know the Apple TV plus is merely a footnote for them so it doesn't matter that no one watches and and the problem with consolidation is is like uh there there's an article we're going to cover tomorrow that's talking about how the thing that Hollywood really wanted out of this writer strike was to be able to start cutting the the the dead weight from a lot of these companies but what it's going to mean is that a lot less creativity because you're only going to have so many places where you can go to get entertainment and a lot of them are becoming tech companies apple is not a media company it's a tech company Amazon was a a book publishing company turned into a Marketplace and they're becoming some of the largest Distributors of entertainment uh and companies like Comcast when you think about just the size of uh of their operation so if they're running your MSNBC and your CNBC so that's your financial news your shitty mainstream press your shitty movies and actually I shouldn't even say shitty they actually made the good uh plenty of the actual good movies that came out this year imagine they consolidate further the same way that um 20th Century Fox got bought by Disney like at one point you had a chance to just go to all of these different places to get your entertainment the old X-Men movies anybody ever seen any the old X-Men movies back in the day very from the Marvel movies you get now right and I think that's a great way to look at it like back then you got these movies from Brian Singer uh which were vastly different from what Marvel would then go on to make eight years later now all anybody can talk about is how they're going to integrate the X-Men into the already previously established Marvel franchises like do we really want to see what it looks like when we have to have uh Super Mario Brothers vers DC or something like that right like it's it's just not interesting to me uh and it and it stifles creativity uh and oh also they also did um Megan this year I thought that that was a pretty good movie I like that one and that's the same Studio that's making the Five Nights at Freddy's movie exactly really well I like if they're so the idea is like if they're going to have to sell if they if they want to sell Warner Brothers Discovery for an actual like profit they'll have to actually make something that makes money which they haven't than Barbie other than no no that was um that was Universal that made Barbie Warner Brothers didn't make Barbie I'm saying Warner Brothers is going to have to have projects that actually make money if they want to sell at a profit and they haven't really been able to do that in the last year is this the type of thing where like do you guys have like we've had this discussion before about like whether men or women have streaming services do you have any streaming services no not really uh no so like cable but cable was a thing right everyone had cable with a thousand choices uh eventually you're only going to have three or four that you're going to be able to choose from and all of the past stuff that's fine but eventually you're going to start seeing all the entertainment looking the same Brett Barbie is a Warner Brothers that's no that's what I'm saying you said it was Universal I said it no I don't think so it's it's a Super Mario Brothers was a universal Barbie was a I'm saying that Warner Brothers will have to have something other than Barbie that makes money yeah yes uh everything else Warner Brothers released this year was crap and the only reason I remember that is because Oppenheimer was Universal and Warner Brothers was Barbie and all and it Christopher Nolan used to make all his movies through Warner Brothers and then switch to Universal after the Flop that was 10 I mean I've half jokingly said that I'm just so tired of having to look up where to stream blank show or movie cuz there's like they are constantly switching licensing and there's like two seasons of this show on Paramount plus and then the other two are on this other one and like I I'm so tired of searching for where to watch things kind of want a big company to just take over all the streaming services if you guys are looking for the answer to that uh if you go to if you have IMDb you don't even have to have IMDb Pro you can set like what streaming services you have right uh and you can check all and then when you look up a show it lists right under there it says you can find this show at this Co also use alternative streaming platforms disou all at least uh but also like so if if they're restructuring DC right now and we have James gun making all of these changes they sell to Universal in two years and it just gets rebooted again and then they just start over again that's what would end up happening I mean I want them to just stop altogether making DC movies because I don't like them I know I know Valiant uh they said they're saying sell within 2 years I know Valiant rade said it probably wouldn't be doable in less than 3 to five but I just uh I want to see in my lifetime both DC and Marvel Run themselves into the ground very plausible I mean at least the the I want to live to see that may not be soon but I want to see it well the the idea would be more that like it would be that they're just less popular now I don't think it's ever going to be that thing where you're like it is now in officially in the ground everyone who has a Marvel tattoo is going to regret it the um I I also wonder if Apple will end up buying Paramount or something like that but that would that would kind of signal like a a strategic shift in where they're looking to take the business and I think they've done very well with their you know Avant guard shows on their little streaming service that they probably write off as a loss every year sance is really good that's the only thing I remember liking from Apple TV but well everybody always complains that there isn't enough new stuff coming out but Apple TV actually does seem to consistent put out new stuff that's not the same cookie cutter stuff that we see all the time also Paramount or now that I think about it Comcast also has John like the John Wick movies because those are Universal so that franchise and they just released the show the Continental uh and the Twisted Metal Series so they're all making grow they're all growing and expanding but it just seems that Warner Brothers can't seem to do it and you don't even necessarily have to have uh Max to watch Discovery if you want CU you can still watch it on Discovery plus that's so stupid like everything from Discovery plus is on Max yeah but some people just don't have Max yeah so they didn't consolidate them like the less streaming services the better in my opinion it does feel like it's gotten out of uh out of hand lately yeah it's not it's not great but I I got rid of Disney plus I'm not going to watch any of the Marvel shows watch why don't you just bite the bullet and get rid of your all of your streaming services I'm never going to do that why cuz I actually watch cuz I actually watch stuff all I I go through I no cuz then I would okay I'll tell you why I'm not going to do that because we won't have to get into that yeah but uh yeah no no don't encourage Brett to cancel his streaming services that I also May partake I had to okay so here's the thing I exposed Expos I think keep them all s Sarah once very graciously asked if she could watch some stupid baking show that nobody watches um clearly um you know dumb no I'm just kidding what was it called again great hallowen bake off these are probably the only shows that make money now Brett don't denigrate the baking shows and the dating shows like these are the these are the shows that actually bring returns I was just watching the newest the newest season of Love is Blind have you guys seen that yet I love that show I haven't seen the new season but it was very fascinating haven't seen the new season so so s Sarah asks to use my my Max subscription but the here's the problem what when I when I go back to check-in cuz I started watching Deadwood again and it's not the Great British Bake Off that's destroying my my continue watching list it's South Park and um Rick and Morty and I will not have Rick and Morty you just expose Sarah as a Rick and Morty fan you know that is Morty Halloween baking Championship to Rick and Morty pipeline is real okay so I what I did there was CU like I just said like look I don't want my continue watching lists um denig like destroyed with this disgusting different profiles and no so what I did is I made I made a second profile so there's Brett and there's not Brett and I just sent her like a video that just pointed like this me this you I never thought yeah did not send I yeah I sent like a video as like me you as if the one that says not Brett isn't very clearly worded in the thing so just very not in my backyard yes like look you can watch whatever you South Park I'm fine with Rick and Morty not so much but saying like it's like but thing like all my stuff like my there's a a beautiful symmetry to all the things I watch right where it's like it's like uh drama drama drama sure there's some DC animated movies in there but then Rick and Morty what is ruined your perfect algorithm it looked it looked so beautiful before and now now my recommends are changing and it's just I won't have it that's what happens when you're a good person bre yeah thank you I do pay for my own Amazon Prime if you ever need it look at that I've got it Amazon Prime that's fine that's fine also Amazon Prime is is easily the worst of all the streaming services at least as far as user experience oh us yeah yeah I will give you that but they have some good stuff on there they have a lot of a lot of good movies there's there's stuff that I watch on there they just have so much money they don't need to care whether their platform is usable or not like uh Netflix is kind of the same right the Netflix is horrible lately it lags really really bad it just stops play it never stopped pissing me off that they autoplay anything you scroll past on yes I hate that yeah you can turn that off on on one of like either on Amazon or on Netflix you can turn that off netx makes like so much of their own stuff that they don't have any good movies when I try to search a movie I actually know or actually like it never Hulu is where you go for that they just want you to watch their shitty shows and movies thanks for watching listen to full episodes of Pop Culture crisis on Spotify keep up with us on social media and make sure you subscribe and ring that Bell so you never miss the show bye guys [Music] w,Syupq6XpAcE," Warner Brothers Discovery is reportedly considering selling the company to Universal. 

Warner Brothers has been struggling financially and has not released a successful movie in the past year. 

Universal, on the other hand, has had a number of successful movies this year, including Oppenheimer, Fast and the Furious, Super Mario Brothers, Cocaine Bear, and Five Nights at Freddy's. 

Comcast, which owns Universal, is the largest media conglomerate in the United States. 

If Warner Brothers Discovery sells to Universal, it would further consolidate the media industry. 

This could lead to less creativity and higher prices for consumers. "
3,Jada is doing a press tour for her upcoming Memoir titled worthy right now um that title should tell you everything you need to know already but she's revealed that not only has she been separated from Will Smith since 2016 she also thought that slapgate was a skit when it happened which is shocking right that is weird I don't believe her you think that she she realized it was serious uh I don't believe I I she lying I just she maybe she thought set up cuz Hollywood does stuff like that a lot the fact that they've been separated for seven years they've been broken up for seven years raises a lot more questions than it answers because in a way she kind of became the Fall Guy for slapgate happening in the first place he's like keep my wife name out your effing mouth this is why I don't believe it she was making that face she was making that well Tech no she is still his wife cuz not they're not not divorced the point is she she so his reaction is visceral where he looks very happy at the he's laughing at the joke and then he sees her reaction and then immediately responds because he's been he's been trained by her to respond like a dog uh and so I I don't believe her that she that she thinks it was so she thinks that it just so happened to really annoy her and then became the perfect skit for her face of annoyance beyond that the drama about her entanglement with another man August Elena is very confusing because I don't know I guess she technically wasn't cheating on Will Smith he theoretically okayed her having a relationship yeah but they weren't together they weren't living together had been living separately for a couple of years at that point but they had said in 2013 that they just uh when asked about an open marriage they said we do whatever we want which could be implied the same way anyways I I find this more annoying because when you look at it like on the macro scale there's supposed to be like this good ex other than her like how she seems to constantly emasculate him they're they're proponents they're large proponents of the idea that non-traditional marriage is great and it works out easy right but that's meanwhile you haven't been together for seven years so there's likely some guy or some girl out there who's like look if Will and Jada can do it we can do it but Will and Jada couldn't do it they couldn't make it work uh that's a kind of a shitty thing to kind of promote when you yourself can't even make it work she seems to be uh she's being koi about it but she seems to suggest that they're thinking about reconciling eventually here is her quote she said we're still figuring it out uh she says they've been separated for 6 years before the Oscars in 2022 quote we've been doing some really heavyduty work together we just got a deep love for each other and we're going to figure out what that looks like let me guess they're going to therapy yeah they're always they're inner work except everything is Will Smith's fault celebrities are literally always in therapy all the time should be protocol honestly uh Hol was messed up they're always in therapy and they're always talking about how great therapy is but nobody ever seems to be getting any better it seems like a racket to me but I um here's what she says about slapgate I thought this is a skit like many people watching the incident unfold she didn't believe it was real at first I was like there's no way that will will hit him it wasn't until will started to walk back to his chair that I even realized it wasn't a skit um her first words utter to will once they were alone after the show were are you okay uh that just sounds like a and he's like wow no he he was shocked by the question cuz she hasn't shown any genuine emotion since like Obama was in office also um Chris Rock allegedly came up to her after the slap happened and was like hey I didn't mean any harm by it like I didn't he apologized for getting slapped he apologized the joke about her Al you I hope really comes out of this more than anything I can't wait to hear Pearl's take on all this oh I will not oh my gosh I had to mute that girl I don't even follow her but she's she dyed her hair blonde she she's like she's like in the midst I she's like she's got all these new thumbnails and I st Ginger stay Ginger she looks better with her natural hair um and she says a lot of things preluded their breakup she also says they she hasn't been able to bring herself to divorce will saying she's been committed to working through anything with him that's a fairly interesting point because look it's it's true like I don't know how if they have like some Ironclad prenup but it's not like they're not both wealthy and just divide it would be like if Jay-Z and Beyonce tried wanted to get divorced there's just too much money and too much part A partnership which is mostly business yeah like the only thing that would really change it would be is if one of them actually fell in love and wanted to get married to someone else which they in which the div is so mentally broken that he's just not capable of that he's he's just he's just sad he's still her lap dog and I'll never like I'll never I'm kind of never going to forgive her because he was the height of cool in the '90s he was cool like every time I see her I want him to when did they get married wasn't it like 1998 or something yeah something like something like that um it's just it's and then he just went down the uncool cringe I mean it happens every age I guess right like uh not everyone can be cool forever Denzel Washington is still cool but he's cool in like a I'm in older and more like mature person kind of cool right Will Smith kind well no cuzz he he transitioned like it's like he transitioned to roles that worked for him as he got older like him like he was actually really good as Deadshot in the Su in a bad movie he was one of the best things about I think Smith's downfall started with like beginning that YouTube channel like trying to be a YouTuber and yeah being in YouTube Rewind saying that's hot cuz he did uh I Am Legend and like I Robot in the last what 10 or 15 years and yeah and like he's been in movies that were relatively successful but his cool Factor has died as of lately I feel like people really liked Bad Boys Bad Boy which they which is uh no Bad Boys 3 technically okay it was technically which is funny because now the fourth one is called four life they should have just saved you know or no three was called bad boys for life and they should have saved that for the fourth one which would made way more sense but they didn't know if it was going to do well enough to justify it that that movie got very lucky because it ended up coming out like right before Co so like if that it would have struggled severely if it it come out after and they asked Jada if she was offended by Chris Rock's joke about her shaved head and she said I mean that's what comedians do I would just have to say that I'm not really here to make any judgment on how people decide to express themselves and Express their art I'll say that several times I've had my feelings hurt for sure I've had my feelings hurt a lot by Chris but at the end of the day to being in the spotlight it comes with the territory like that is that is the a beautiful response that I don't believe for a second she actually had after it happened yeah how can you believe like anything that they say really when they had uh didn't they have a whole show or at least a huge viral Roundtable discussion about how much the entanglement hurt will and hurt his feelings because she had an affair but if they were separated is it really an affair confusing yeah is it still an affair yeah like are they still if you're still married you should not be in other relationships while you're still married I absolutely agree with that but like clearly like from the under stood between them I forgot he was also he was also the genie in Aladdin yes he was which was like actually didn't go as bad as people thought it was going to go because how do you replace Robin Williams he didn't act poorly like he's uh he's been been fine right um also he won his first and he won his first uh Oscar last year for King Richard the S no one no one cared that he you know committed slapgate they just kind of put that behind them and let him win anyway and he bright which was clumsily made Chris Rock allegedly tried to get with Jana in the middle of one of their separation on and off stage before or after before or after here's what she says I think every summer all the reports would come out that me and will were getting a divorce and this particular Summer she won't clarify which one Chris Rock thought that we were getting a divorce so he called me and basically was like I'd love to take you out and I was like what do you mean he said well aren't you and will getting a divorce I was like no Chris those are just rumors he was appalled and he profusely apologized and that was that so he felt he felt dissed and he's like now I got to make fun of her hair yeah I think that might be it he was the the burned incel he just look I I feel uh it was personal I feel bad for the public more than I feel bad for any of them because it just proves that it's all fake I'm sorry what man would be attracted to J pinket Smith knowing who she is right especially after the entanglement men that men that are into being like maybe guys who like having do Matrix oh Mists I think my ego is too big right now let me go down really bad so CEOs you know that's that's true CEOs love that [ __ ] also Leslie Jones recently uh revealed that Chris Rock had to go to counseling after slapgate oh God she said that [ __ ] was humiliating it really affected him people need to understand his daughters his parents saw that he had to go to counseling with his daughters who are 21 and 19 years old that kind of makes them sound like they're in second grade yeah it's also funny because he handled it about as good as you could handle that situation he didn't handle it poorly he just he made a joke about how he's like dude it was a joke bro yeah and like he didn't come out of that situation looking worse so I don't know what he was supposed to do like I don't understand where I mean I guess like who am I to tell him he's not supposed to go into therapy but at the same time I'm like cuz my from what I take from it he took the therapy because he felt emasculated but he handled that situation in a very masculine way I think both of them were emasculated by that it would be yeah like so what he's saying is that uh maybe if he had done the toxic masculine response which would be to like just drop him yeah um then he wouldn't have need to go to therapy because he wouldn't have felt uh emasculated yeah yeah I guess like what why do we need Logan Paul versus Dylan danis why can't we have Will Smith versus Chris Rock yeah how Chang and it would be funny too because it would end up being for Will Smith cuz he's probably in better shape and absolutely Chris Rock is like half his size it wasn't a fair fight y it would also um we uh had the poll today asking you guys who's the worst member of the Smith family Jada it looks like Jada's winning very handily but just to be contrarian I voted will because uh he needs to take charge of his his own family you know yeah yep he he's being J just because Jaden's annoying and how are mirrors real if our eyes aren't real Jaden Jaden that you know that comment Jaden made it makes a lot more sense when you see that Jada uh had her whole family take iasa trips oh my goodness for like psychic healing W I did not know about that where were these moms when I wasid yeah Jada also revealed in the same interview that she was struggling with suicidal ideation for a long time IA works for that and that she took iasa and her suicidal ideation ceased but that her whole family yeah her kids has yeah taken iasa I don't know if they did together psychedelic the kids she made sure we knew they're adults when they did this not when they were minors but that's intense yeah way less intense things you can do you're makes more sense why Jaden Jaden has this like split Consciousness asking like are our eyes real like full on philosopher now yeah his neural path he kind of struggles because it makes him look like a tryhard and it's it's kind of embarrassing didn't he want to have like his uh like male genitalia removed at one point wasn't that a thing I'm not Googling that I don't think he did but he said he wanted I just know that he started like wearing skirts and painting his nails like a lot of male celebrities do okay but I don't know if it went as far as like transitioning he was questioning it I believe yeah oh well I mean when you have a male role model like Will Smith in your family like how do you make sense of being a man you know what they do they send him to therapy and they have him watch all of the old Will Smith movies reinforce being it's just it's just reinforce that toxic masculine it's a 20 minute clip of just him hitting the alien in Independence Day goes Welcome To Earth over and over again and they just keep playing that clip Until you realize that your dad's actually pretty cool and then they're like did you know that there's a whole channel in Philadelphia dedicated to The Fresh Prince of Bel Air your dad dad did that he wasn't always being you know torn to shreds by your by your emasculating mom jeez bad stuff the whole but that's I mean that's like that's why I would never want to be a celebrity right I would never want to have to uh let my family life play out in front of stink bug no we're under attack I would never want to have my family life play out in front of like the whole world it would be hor no there's a way to protect your family from it too and they just lean into it and put it on blast Jada is the embodiment of toxic femininity yeah also yeah thankfully red table talk is no longer a thing will should start his own one called black table talk or Blue Table talk or just not red table talk some color I wonder is this the kind of thing where Will Smith was already kind of like this or did Jada kind of infiltrate and was she just one of those women that they warn men about who's kind of like witchy and toxic and plays all these Mind Games to the point where he's just like the way she describes them getting together is she was single Will Smith uh got out of her relationship and then called her saying like who are you dating right now and she said she's single and he said okay you're dating me now so that makes him sound like the alpha in the in the relationship and what it is is that offended her and she played the long game she destroy this whole life well in this interview she she laughs to the interviewer and says can you believe I fell for that oh my gosh doesn't seem like she likes thing where like when when when she when they had like their like they did like an interview in 2019 where they talk about it's like we don't celebrate our anniversary that's cuz you're barely married anymore but like recently he posted a like it was like last year on her on their anniversary or whatever or her birthday it was on their anniversary like uh he posted some sweet message to her and like two days later she posted a thing about dancing with Tupac like like just emasculating another part of this that's super confusing is that viral video that Will Smith um posted where Jada was recording him in their house yeah and he said like don't record me in my own home like whatever but they apparently were living apart by that point anyway so how does that video even come into existence like it's cuz it's all fake The Whole World's fake it's all a stage she really did just want Tupac she she had to she feels like she settled for Will Smith yeah she got with him when he was like the alpha and then once he his time passed she was like should have gotten with Tupac thanks for watching listen to full episodes of Pop

out because as usual somebody's releasing a book so titillating conversation has to happen Will Smith and J pinket Smith have been separated for seven years and that calls into question a lot of things was the entanglement actually an entanglement why the hell would you punch a guy for a woman you're not even living with anymore Chris Rock is literally the victim of having to uh play it play it up as if you guys are still together so we're going to talk about that it's very strange to me but uh it's Hollywood makes perfect sense we're also going to talk a little bit about how there is a rumor going around right now that Universal Comcast is looking to purchase Warner Brothers Discovery at some point in the next two years which is very very quickly so I want to talk about that I've got a lot of thoughts also uh tell me about what's going on with Julia Fox Julia Fox is putting out a memoir as well women be right writing Memoirs these days huh lot to say it really is like the celebrity to trauma to to Memoir pipeline she yeah so Julia Fox is also putting out a memoir and she is going to be trauma dumping about her relationship with Kanye that lasted less than a month yeah really milking that still but the detail I I just love the salacious details like I'm falling for the marketing Ploy I'm shocked it was so shortlived cuz she talks about it still constantly in well she talks about nothing else interesting about her people keep asking her about it like they're not going to stop asking her about it until she tells all yeah I just thought it was a lot longer wow but uh I didn't know about this this pee incident that she details in I shared it with you today I was like I was like cuz to me I was just like is known for peeing in places where he is not supposed to pee it's uh if you're a guy and you've ever gone to a college bar and there's been a some type of Alleyway behind that bar I'm just saying that it's not anything new you say all guys do this I did not I would never I mean I would if I was we just got back from Miami and I saw two dudes openly peeing like on a Main Street into the puddles so apparently it happens it's a thing May Kanye it's a privilege yeah he was like he felt like he was blessing that wall with his urine so we're going to talk about that we're also going to talk about a United States streamer named Johnny Somali not related to Johnny Sunami completely different person who has been arrested in Japan for committing criminal Acts including threatening them with nuclear war okay that's a little bit of an exaggeration but it's not it's not at all he's been arrested so we're going to get into it because people will be doing anything they can for fame these days ladies and gentlemen so let's go ahead and and get started but before we do would you hit the like button on this video would you subscribe to this channel if you have not done so already we did just pass 72,000 subscribers so thank you very much we are on our way to 75,000 thank you for that hit the like button on this video and turn the notification Bell on so you can be notified anytime one of these episodes or segments goes live I actually saw a couple of comments recently that said they get notified for everything but the movie reviews like they never see the when we when we cut has a vendetta against our movie reviews they don't they don't like it so we got that also remember all super chats $20 and over we will interrupt the discussion we will read them right then and there then we will get right back on topic so if you three ladies are ready we will get started Cara are you ready ready ready ready the in the room is spoken ladies and Gentlemen let's get going all right first things first there's a couple of quick announcements here uh not looking good for Aquaman right now uh even after the sequel was recut test screenings for Aquaman in the lost kingdom reportedly still received the score in the low 60s not exactly a passing grade and not exactly good for Warner Brothers when they've had failure after failure after failure I think that instead of an Aquaman 2 they should have made a Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy movie mhm that would have done numbers MH it could have just made the mara movie and just made just made Amber herd the stara movie they could have done that that would have been great how would that do well just because of hate watching no no maybe on streaming maybe it's like a streaming show but I don't think anyone's going to pay the prices the exorbitant prices it costs to go to the theaters just cuz they want to boo Amber herd for an hour and 45 minutes well this also says that the current version of the movie hasn't been screen tested at all there's so they're just they're just going to throw it out there they don't really care and you know that there's going to be at least one cut that where they're going to just cut Amber herd out of it entirely like some people always do that like there's there's people that went back through the Avengers movies and cut out all the women like because how long are the movies then no yeah still pretty much the same length it was old Marvel he like uh you know it's the way it was back then there just there wasn't as much force diversity about it all the way back in 2019 all all those years ago back the good old days back in old days wokeness took over we had to put up hey Ghostbusters with all women was in 2016 so it already been going on for a couple of years there all right guys so you know it's coming up we've got that we've got the Marvels I can't say that I'm looking very much to either of them but we are going to have these movies to be coming out we will be reviewing it so have no fear that will be happening uh do you guys like okay so given everything you know about what happened with Amber herd would it like bother you guys to watch something with her in it I mean if she's good at it it wouldn't bother me no I mean I don't boycott Michael Jackson's music I his music great you know but you know he's just an artist yeah he sleepovers with children yeah I mean nothing you can do but she's not like that great of an actress though so I'd be like homework is so incredible I can Overlook yeah it's like bu light again like I wasn't drinking Bud Light anyway so yeah boycott approved yeah she's like I I won't boycott on in on principle kind of like it's like there's plenty of especially given like the sliding scale of what people consider boycott offenses like a lot of people will just not watch a lot of movies and television these days just because the celebrities in them say stuff that they don't like well you know that's the case toour for most people and I just I'm not going to use it first of all it's impossible to keep up with it like the average person can't keep up they've got like their checklist like I'm going to have to have this list on my phone like somebody should create a database The anti-woke Patriot database this would would be called Patriot database I mean isn't that just Public Square yeah well no this is the opposite where it's like you're you're watching a movie so it's like IMDb or like have you ever notice like if you watch Amazon Prime if you pause a scene and you click down it has a a feature called x-ray which lists all the actors that are in that scene first of all that's just like powered by IMDb right but like I need one where I can take a picture of a scene and it lists all their stupid tweets well I've learned I didn't know this but Jason mimoa has a lot of haters because he made a joke about no because he made he made a joke about raping beautiful women uh in he okay so what he said was he loves doing fantasy and sci-fi so he can rip people's tongues out of their throats and rape beautiful women it was a joke it was a joke but then character okay so but he apologize I'm like but he what notice that he didn't apologize to the people who have had their tongues RI ripped out because they couldn't complain about it oh hey right like this is going to end up being your cancelable offense because I mimicked a person who doesn't have a I have a hole in my tongue so technically I'm like I'm half you're halfway there I'm halfway there right why do you have a hole in your tongue I bit through it when I was very young oh okay not pierced okay no not piered accident got you my uh my brother power bought me through a table a see siblings man you could have just stopped at brother I feel you I got exactly bro bro right my brother period all right right some other news ladies and gentlemen so Marvel has let go of all of the writers and directors for Daredevil born again this is good news because it's Disney so likely their first choices were awful anyways and they're talking about how they're restructuring the show to make it more of an action a darker action series as opposed to what they said it was going to be like which was a courtroom drama where he doesn't even he wasn't even going to end up in the Daredevil costume until episode 4 but if you remember they already tried to make She-Hulk attorney at law and they realized that nobody there that got hired knew how to write scenes that involved the law that wasn't a legal drama it was more a I mean it's called She-Hulk attorney at law a comedy I don't think that's why the show was bad though but the point is like they said that what they said there was like there was like um interviews with the the showrunner said like when they got started they got they all got together all the women all the men that they get together and they're writing the show and they're like yeah we tried to write a courtroom drama and realize none of us know how so he just stopped yeah so you know life comes at you fast who is Megan the stallion's manager who is like I know the perfect cameos for you She-Hulk you twerk in She-Hulk and then then you'll have an appearance and dicks the musical yeah did you guys see that dick dicks the musical no it's an a24 movie coming out please tell me it's about someone named Richard I literally I said what if it would be called like musical the dicks or something like that but yeah no it's a it's a what is it called uh they it was literally described as a queer queer version of The Parent Trap yeah yeah and uh the identical twins end up getting married in the film so there's that Hollywood really loves to push those incest stories man they do that's creepy they're like Love Is Love even brotherly if you're related y the uh the the crisis meter's catching up slow today but it is working ladies and gentlemen just just just a heads up I don't know if that's the wait it says Brett was already canceled because of mocha hate I just wanted to hear the story real quick he doesn't look canceled to me look just because Olivia has a derpy cat that I rightfully call out as Derpy looking does not make me cancelable it's not my fault if you want me to not be to not be mean to Derpy cats don't have Derpy cats that's I almost made the poll we almost made the poll today mocha vers bcus but I didn't want to do that to mocha cuz I'm merciful and I wouldn't do that to to mocha I'm I'm a kind I'm a benevolent I'm a benevolent dictator don't want to see them I I I know it's just that cat it's just that cat I I love I love Bokus I I post pictures of bcus all the time I in fact I was going to add bcus to cute of the day today but I decided to save it just in case I've got a whole arsenal of bcus photos that we can use at some point but you know it I had a question is the Netflix daredevil show on Netflix still or did Disney plus take it uh no it's on Disney plus now okay that was a big deal when it first happened because they they were talking about how it's it's absolutely not like a PG show so it was like does everything on Disney Plus have to be PG well that was a big topic of discussion for a while that when they started implementing these Netflix shows that were very clearly not PG so they've kind of like softened the rules on that and people were worried that they were going to get censored and be less uh less um edgy but those shows were dark and very very brutal um especially that in like the scenes with the Punisher so you know they put content warnings before them I believe so uh and speaking of bad news for Disney they're getting in trouble because apparently they ran this ad for Loki season 2 and I've seen a lot of people talking about it but uh the apparently it looks like they created it with AI and people are very mad as if they thought these companies weren't going to just keep doing this right I mean maybe they just thought no one would notice like would catch it but now that I'm looking at it I didn't think it at first but if you look at the background it's a little wonky like it could definitely be made in in mid Journey one of my favorite um my like some of my favorite like Normie influencers have been doing the um the yearbook CH AI challenge thing have you seen that yeah uh anybody here done that no it's crazy realistic is it yeah did did I didn't try it though you should you should try it well that's what these are all doing is they're making the AI better yeah well but do you remember like last year there was that Trend going around where everybody would feed their image into this thing it would like it would give you like an idealized version of yourself feing the algorithm those images now look very primitive compared to what AI is capable of this year um but this says madly disappointed they're using AI generated imagery to promote Loki I don't know why you would be morally outraged by that but um someone said are you sure it's AI looks like badly photoshopped promo the characters look like cutouts from frame grabs which is actually like a perfect example of like explanation of how AI is going to affect the workplace which is like sure the really good Photoshop artists aren't going to lose their work but the really mediocre ones could struggle could end up struggling to find my passion yeah exactly like they could end up struggling because they're like look your your work is subpar we can feed this into mid journey and get something better quicker or at least something on par quicker the clock is giving all the AI telltale signs like things randomly turning into meaningless squiggles I love it but one of the ones that uh that the this influencer posted of was her was like all of it was like hers and like her and her like her husband roasts them cuz like she has like a video series Shea Milani where she was she'll sing popular songs and her husband will just make fun of her singing while she's doing it and that's like the whole it's called interrupted but she did this trend and it's like posting all the photos and he's making fun of her and there's one where it's like she's like in a basketball uniform but it doesn't have a number it has a backwards letter C and the name name of the team is illegible in backwards uh because that's you know those are the little details that and fingers they always get fingers yeah fingers are fingers are difficult so yeah um Disney's going to have all sorts of problems we know that this is going to keep happening and they're going to continue to use and you're right like maybe in a couple years these types of segments where they'll be able to use AI won't be caught as easily definitely they'll trick people did you guys see that Kylie Jenner lost 330,000 Instagram followers after her post on Israel in which she deleted I have not seen that the reports I saw were larger numbers like in the millions butow who can say I say 330,000 for her isn't really a whole lot I saw like something like over a million so like that's crazy when you think like when we say like don't apologize and don't delete it this is why because it's not going to it's not going to matter don't don't post in the first place cuz then GJ Hadid who who is Palestinian herself posted this long essay about the issue right now uh where she was kind of you know balanced between both sides of the conversation and distan herself from the free Palestine movement um and despite being Palestinian herself is now being attacked for that because she's distancing herself from the political movement that's attached to it so she's going to start losing followers as well I'm sure do you guys remember when Ariana Grande said she hated America and that was like a huge thing do you know how much she she lost how many followers but like that was back in what 2014 it was an election year I thought it was an election year I thought it it was like coming up on 2016 yeah but the tide has changed so much now they're like yeah we hate America too she would be celebrated for that today isn't that so weird maybe like she ate that yeah but she like no she like licked a donut yes was on a display case and then said I hate America it's one of the it's one of the big reasons why this what's going on right now has been so controversial for celebrities is they have no idea what to do because normally they're like did a white guy do it they're bad did America do it they're bad you know there's very clear lines as to how you're supposed to support and how you're not supposed to support but for these Ryan long did an amazing video today about a celebrity trying to figure out who he's supposed to support in I re I don't want to play it because I don't know if he wants to whether it's copyright whatever but I recommend everyone go check it out he's uh he it's kind of like remember when he did the video like woke vers racist yeah like it's it's very much like that he's very smart with his like with his comedy I never miss a St like he he get keep stunning he's like he's like I think I'm the real victim here like the fact that me I'm the victim here cuz I can't figure out who the hell I'm supposed to support like so politicized it's all the same and uh Noah schnap from stranger things has also posted a long-winded essay about this he said you either stand with Israel or you stand with terrorism it shouldn't be a difficult Choice shame on you um and a lot of his Zoomer followers are not liking that one person replied he's going get a whole new audience amongst conservatives now yeah he said um I really do wonder if celebrities are posting about Israel because they're educated about the conflict and are willingly siding with the oppressor or because they view it as an Instagram Trend I like should that even be a question like are influencers educated about geopolitics this could be the only clear answer is no this could be the only time in history we might see like a stranger things cast member get retweeted by Lindsey Graham oh wow uh also someone tweeted about Gigi Hadid saying uh Gigi Hadid calling what Palestine is going through a conflict between two countries is disgusting they're just what a statement they're they really are like they're they're addicted to needing to have an opinion like I I love not having have an opinion like considering my job I love not having to have an opinion on on a lot of stuff for for many things like could have like planned a better Perpetual conflict they they they did no resolution the same thing was happening being from Minnesota during the riots in 2020 um you were expected to have like if you're in a Minnesota Facebook group or you or you posted a black you were expected to post a black square and have an opinion and it had to be their opinion otherwise you were wrong uh ignoring the fact that you just don't necessarily have to have an opinion on these things I mean this is going on right now in Hollywood like there was a an article from Breitbart that said like these the top 10 celebrities on Instagram didn't post anything about it I'm like okay like weren't we the ones a couple years ago saying they're morons anyways who needs their opinion on geopolitics and race relations telling celebrities to stop posting about politics all the time yeah I would like continue being silent and no was saying oh all of the people who were posting about fashionable causes like Ukraine and climate change are silent now like yeah they could they should have kept their mouths shut about Ukraine and climate change as well and he didn't mention BLM because he wouldd be attacked for mentioning that or or not the fact that a cause is fashionable at all shows that they don't care uh and I mean but we're going to be talking about that with when we talk about Jada pinket Smith right it's like they've have to leverage their personal lives in a way that makes it impossible to distinguish between what your actual beliefs are and what how how much of your personality you're willing to Forfeit for the the common like for whatever the current remember the current thing meme that was perhap the greatest meme in the last 10 years was the current thing meme it really is true there's a $20 one here from Tony gavara says re do you want long would somebody like to say that with more enthusiasm than salty Army baby there you go perfect that was fantastic ladies and gentlemen oh also this was casually dropped the other day apparently uh Keith D confessed that he killed Tupac on P Diddy's orders uh for a million dollar that's not that much money no it's not I mean a million 96 was a lot of money but still like when you think about what it turned into that's crazy wait why would P didy have an interest in putting a out on Tupac well back then it was the East Coast West Coast feuds and gangster rappers used to actually be gangster it's not like the how the rap is today so talking about that yesterday like about like they're like they they like make fun of each other on Twitter and they do podcasts making fun of each other um do you no do you remember this was like early days when we started the show of the rapper who died and they like hoisted him up at the nightclub oh yeah it wasn't a super well-known rapper dude they embalmed his body and put it on display at a club for his like I guess this was his funeral reception at a nightclub was it a cultural thing cuz there's that's that's a common practice in some places so interesting you're think like New Orleans or something right W there they were I don't know they were in America yes it was like Detroit or something yeah it was that's awkward so can you guys do that I got you thank you you up for the last episode of PCC right there in the chair we'll just yeah we'll just it'll be like no what we'll do is we'll Weekend at Bernie's you for a whole weekend we just take we'll take you around that's how I want to be remembered it' be great it' be fantastic like an old lady with my grand kids Wild um but you know I I mean I still believe that it's probably more likely that Suge Knight had a lot more to do with this but that's I don't know anything about that's just me you ever hear Knight like uh alluding to the fact that he gave um who was the rapper that famously died of HIV uh who was in NWA yeah yeah yeah he like alluded once on some like Conan or late night talk show that he like had something to do with um e getting AIDS what like he also apparently like I he knew how to give it to people yeah what well if he was I mean hey nobody didn't know what it probably was it was probably right after California decriminalized it like oh I can talk about this now uh cuz California made it no it's no longer a felony in the state of California to give to knowingly give someone HIV so he's like yes I can talk about this now fantastic uh because yeah like nobody likes jugg Knight dude pretty CL there's also this story about him now this is I think it's been like um debunked later that he like held vanilla iced by the ankles off of a hotel balcony like Michael Jackson style yeah apparently that was softened to like he just sternly yelled at him on a balcony but it like it turned into like ice and the crosshairs yeah shook his lunch money down it was it was over like he's like you owe me money for a song I don't remember like for the beat on a song or something like that yeah I remember that story and all I could think about was like because do do you ever remember the video when Jim Carrey like impersonated vanilla ice oh yeah right he's got he's got the even more ridiculous hair I'm picturing like that's how Vanilla Ice got his hair style cuz he's being hung upside down and his hair just fell that way and then when he got up he just yelled it up like that cuz he had like the high the high fade that was just super high right there happy accident yeah he like this looks kind of good he's I I like that I like that idea a lot all right oh and we've got an update cuz Mary you know pro-life Spider-Man right do you know him no what do you did you think that I you met him or something at the event okay why did you think I I friends with prif Spider-Man he allegedly contact like oh yeah all pro lifee people just like know each other just hang out it might have been Sheamus that I talked to about him maybe oh maybe he's friends with I have idea you think all Catholics look yeah you all look the same it's you know but he he just got charged with uh Reckless conduct and trespassing for his latest stunt where he scaled a Chicago skyscraper on behalf of a mother who was scheduled for an abortion um on the 14th so I guess he's gonna get out of these charges as well he's been charged in the past maybe he just pays the fines I have no idea how I still want to know what pro-life Wolverine has to say about this stuff that's a that's a person too yeah like what is his I have no idea what pro-life Wolverine does to help people but if if he had fallen pro-life Iron Man could have definitely caught him before he fell uh but it's you know it's kind of a wholesome story but he he does this and then he links to a support page where you can donate to the woman who is considering abortion it's the more wholesome TR like route to influencer hood he doesn't like kill himself doing one of these stunts one day cuz it's extremely dangerous extremely dangerous yeah yeah he is Spider-Man yeah um what wait so he got arrested for it's criminal trespassing and Reckless and didn't go in the building he just went on the building yeah but you have to get up to the top so take down you have to go through the building you know what it makes me think of is that Andrew Tate video that you sent me he's like I'm Spider-Man get over here I wonder if he get talk spider are you saying that they wait for him on the rooftop of these skyscrapers yeah to take him down to the yeah okay I mean they can't risk intercepting him on the building that would be insane right imagine you're just in your office in one of these skyscrapers and you're just like trying to get a spreadsheet done and you see this outside of drone yeah here it is oh my goodness it's like a Trope in movies and television too where like a guy is like climbing up the side of like a building and there's just somebody in an office yeah and this was in Chicago yeah okay I remember um whoa it was really cool to see like the the window washers go outside the the window of my dad's office are you excited about that yeah it was always like scared me a little bit there's also like there's a very wholesome video of like a it's like a kid and like a terminal cancer Ward he's got the big windows up front in his in his room and the window washer all dressed up like The Avengers yeah I saw that that's that's pretty wholesome too right so oh so he says wear his colors like I like should he be wearing a I bet you he'd get sued by Disney if you wore a Spider-Man costume while doing it or Sony right or yes I'm sorry Sony but like do you remember when um uh uh cuz no Sony only owns the rights to the to the movie to the to the movie right only owns the movie rights but like there was a this famous story of a a child who died who loved Spider-Man and the dad put Spider-man on his gravestone and Disney made them take it off oh that's Rotten Disney because they're evil cuz they're evil or or should I look I I actually work very hard most of the time like I'm actually the person usually on the other side of this argument who's like look it's profit seeking entity they can't really they they they don't have emotions right but at the same time you think somebody in their PR department would be like look the human to I feel a little wrong about this like they're like cuz like like what what is the logic like like maybe their logic we let this guy then everybody's going to have a Spider-Man grave I mean I think their their logic is nobody's going to hear about this and then it ended up blowing up as a story so Jee all right what would you ladies like to see would you like to see C of the day or would you like to see cringe of the day let's look a cute cute of the day all right first things first this is Mary sent me this when it says twitch streamer finds a raccoon living their best life that's a raccoon yeah I didn't know there were red albino oh it's so cute I usually don't like raccoons but that's this one's a cute one oh my goodness I've never seen this before okay I want one oh my God oh yes I love that they have opposable thumbs yeah B I'm not don't touch the raccoon don't touch the raccoon you can give him food but you can't touch him and then somebody put like Rocket Raccoon here and his has him winking a cookie really you're like are you serious you're giving me this [ __ ] sure you could get rabies just by touching it you don't have to get bidden by them there you go wait really yeah at least with bats I don't know I'm assuming they're arguing the chat like pro-choice Dr Manhattan is there is there a Planned Parenthood Spiderman like probably Pro have any cool superheroes they would have they would have villains so it would be like be it would be like Pro it it would be pro-choice doc do Choice Captain Marvel no she's still technically a good guy so it' have to be like pro-choice vulture pro-choice Edwards is her hands well sure there we go it's an antihero I mean that like yeah because no cuz Pro okay so what it is I said it said Pro prolife Wolverine would take the adamantium claws and give like an emergency C-section no and in Pro and pro-choice and pro-choice Edward Scissor Hands would just go straight just bad just bad guys don't it's getting dark dark bro you took it there all right that's where my brain goes sorry all right we got a couple more here this one is from Kevin White says meet pepperoni pizza the Wonder pup she's bucket of love this was 13 years ago and she's still going she answers to Ron oh to to roony roony sorry uh and roon and bacon bacon very cute so cute very cute let's do one more here is that a black lab one of my looks like a black Lab One my favorite we got one more here this this is from Jacob they can't see me says this is my little girl Lucy she's a 2-year-old uh is that Basenji I don't know how to pronounce that and I think her ears were getting cold it's very cute I love it all right uh let's do some cringe of the day now that we've gotten our fix of cute in Mary sent me this I have not seen this yet so an influencers in the wild it says fellas oh how am I not following influencers in the wild fix that fellas if the if the makes you do this on the first date what you do what that's horrible English that wasn't me WR by AI for sure fellas if the makes you do this on the first date what you do here we go oh that was a pretty good push in he did oh I see he's clearly worked with a gimbal before he knows what he's professional yep smooth he's got skill the real question is is she going to change the song or leave the song because it might be copyrighted she's got to use the official Instagram version of it so that she doesn't get a copyright notice and get in trouble right have you ever asked someone in public to take a photo of you and you can tell if he's been trained or not yeah right we we talked about this when we were talking about no no cuz me and you talked about this me and you talked about the mom who sends her kids the do you remember that you sent me this recently the the mom who like teaching my son how to put the toilet SE down there's another one of a lady's like teaching my son how to take good photos so that your daughter won't have to ask a thousand times just destroying the kid self there was one time like I had to tell the guy I was like it's okay you you can stop taking phot phot I just needed one just one angle's good when someone asks me to take photos I do like literally every angle every setting yeah if it's for a girlfriend like a female friend I will the um there there's a um there's a great Babylon be skit that they do where it's like a it's like a meme where like a couples's like they're by the water and they're looking out at the water and they're like oh could you take a picture of us and the guy's like sure sure and he takes the picture for them they look at it they go thank you and he leaves and then you he hears them say Sir could you take a picture of us clearly indicating that he was very bad at what he did so they had to ask the next guy to ask again influencers kind of stopped taking those types of pictures where like the girl is looking back at the camera with her hand out oh yeah you know what I mean they're holding hands because it's a classic like he pays for everything but I don't want to put him on screen he paid for this vacation but he's not going on camera right either because he's married or he just he's he's an investment banker or works at some um you know he just you know he wants to stay out of it yeah cuz it's Jeff Jeff Bezos behind the camera the other the other one that was uh recently was like all of the it's like it's like POV you're a millennial in the year 2016 say it's like take me back to to Mexico 2016 y um cuz that was that was actually the before that trend of like the girls uh woman crush Wednesday there was there was a a guy who did one he says uh he goes taking my my daughters on all sorts of Vacations so she won't be impress by your dusty trip to Tampa Bay or something like that you know see I actually find it Le more wholesome when the guy does it like like we were talking about that like when the the moms are doing the thing where she's like teaching my son how to do this because because men are apparently awful it somehow would be more wholesome if it was the guy teaching his son to do it because it's actually supposed to be the guy's job to teach him how to be a man right um obviously I'm I'm oversimplifying that in a lot of ways and it's all about the praise of the mom the camera always pans to the mom doing this because it's more about her getting approval from the the people who leave the comments and say oh my gosh you're doing such a service to humanity for doing this by well this kid's going to grow up being like yeah but what am I worth like what is she like yeah she made me do she made me put the toilet seat down this one time so she could film it but that that was it it's like girl ever says it it's like yeah there's like it takes two seconds to put the toilet seat down it's like it takes 2 seconds to put the toilet seat up no I I hate that rule so much I do not with that rule I don't know where it came from but if you pee with the seat up like I'm a grown person I can put it down I don't know where that came from it needs to stop uh well you know it's not that big a deal it's not a big deal it's a trap ladies and gentlemen ignore them they're lying no they're setting you up for it means grow up let them keep it upat I agree with that but don't get mad about it don't let it ruin your bed yeah don't let it run your cuz then when they're done they're going to be like it's fine and we all know that when a woman says it's fine it's literally anything but fine right there the fact of the matter all right let's go ahead and get started then shall we Mary tell us what the hell is going on with Will Smith and Jada pinket Smith Jada is doing a press tour for her upcoming Memoir titled worthy right now um that title should tell you everything you need to know already but she's revealed that not only has she been separated from Will Smith since 2016 she also thought that slapgate was a skit when it happened which is shocking right that is weird I don't believe her you think that she she realized it was serious uh I don't believe I I she's lying just she maybe she thought it was like a setup cuz Hollywood does stuff like that a lot the fact that they've been separated for seven years they've been broken up for seven years raises a lot more questions than it answers because in a way she kind of became the Fall Guy for slapgate happening in the first place he's like keep my wife name out your effing mouth this is why I don't believe it she was making that face she was making that well Tech no she is still his wife cuz they're not they're not div dived the point is she she so his reaction is visceral where he looks very happy at the he's laughing at the joke and then he sees her reaction and then immediately responds CU he's been he's been trained by her to respond like a dog uh and so I I don't believe her that she that she thinks it was so she thinks that it just so happened to really annoy her and then became the perfect skit for her face of annoyance beond that the drama about her entanglement with another man August Elena is very confusing because I don't know I guess she technically wasn't cheating on Will Smith he theoretically okayed her having a relationship yeah but they weren't together they weren't living together had been living separately for a couple of years at that point but they had said in 2013 that they just uh when asked about an open marriage they said we do whatever we want which could be implied the same way anyways I I find this more annoying because when you look at it like on the macro scale there's supposed to be like this good other than her like how she seems to constantly emasculate him they're they're proponents they're large proponents of the idea that non-traditional marriage is great and it works out easy right but that's meanwhile you haven't been together s years so there's likely some guy or some girl out there who's like look if Will and Jada can do it we can do it but Will and Jada couldn't do it they couldn't make it work uh that's a kind of a shitty thing to kind of promote when you yourself can't even make it work she seems to be uh she's being koi about it but she seems to suggest that they're thinking about reconciling eventually here is her quote she said we're still figuring it out uh she says they've been separated for six years before the Oscars in 2022 quote we've been doing some really heavy duty work together we just got a deep love for each other and we're going to figure out what that looks like let me guess they're going to therapy yeah they're always they're C inner work except everything is Will Smith's fault celebrities are literally always in therapy all the time that should be protocol honestly Hollywood messed up they're always in therapy and they're always talking about how great therapy is but nobody ever seems to be getting any better seems like a racket it seems like a racket to me but what I um here's what she says about slapgate I thought this is a skit like many people watching the incident unfold she didn't believe it was real at first I was like there's no way that will will hit him it wasn't until will started to walk back to his chair that I even realized it wasn't a skit um her first words uttered to will once they were alone after the show were are you okay uh that just sounds like a and he's like question no he he was shocked by the question because she hasn't shown any genuine emotion since like Obama was in office also um Chris Rock allegedly came up to her after the slap happened and was like hey I didn't mean any harm by it like I didn't he apologize for getting slapped he apologized to her for saying the joke about her alope you know I hope really comes out of this more than anything I can't wait to hear Pearl's take on all this yeah oh I will not oh my gosh I had to mute that girl I don't even follow her but she she DED her hair blonde she she's like she's like in the midst I yeah she's like she's got all these new thumbnails and stay Ginger she looks better with her natural hair um and she says a lot of things preluded their breakup she also says they she hasn't been able to bring herself to divorce will saying she's been committed to working through anything with him that's a fairly interesting point because look it's it's true like I don't know how if they have like some Ironclad prenup but it's not like they're not both wealthy and just divide it would be like if Jay-Z and Beyonce tried wanted to get divorced there's just too much money part A partnership which is mostly business yeah like the only thing that would really change it would be is if one of them actually fell in love and wanted to get married to someone else which they don't in which case the divorce so Mally broken that he's just not capable of that he's he's just he's just sad he's still her lap dog and I'll never like I'll never I'm kind of never going to forgive her because he was the height of cool in the 90s she was cool like every time I see her I want him to when did they get married wasn't like 1998 or something yeah something like something like that um it's just it's and then he just went down the uncool cringe I mean it happens to everyone as they age I guess right like uh not everyone can be cool forever Denzel Washington is still cool but he's cool and like a I'm an older and more like mature person kind of cool right Will Smith kind well no cuz he he transitioned like it's like he transitioned to roles that worked for him as he got older like him like he was actually really good as Deadshot in the Su in a bad movie he was one of the best things about I think Smith's downfall started with like beginning that YouTube channel like trying to be a YouTuber and relatable yeah being in YouTube Rewind saying that's hot cuz he did uh I Am Legend and like I Robot in the last what 10 or 15 years and yeah and like he's been in movies that were relatively successful but his cool Factor has died as of lately I feel like people really liked Bad Boys which they which is uh no bad boys three technically okay it was technically which is funny because now the fourth one is called four life they should have just saved you know or no three was called Bad Boys for life and they should have saved that for the fourth one which would have made way more sense but they didn't know if it was going to do well enough to justify it that that movie got very lucky because it ended up coming out like right before coid so like if that it would have struggled severely if it it come out after and uh they asked Jada if she was offended by Chris Rock joke about her shaved head and she said I mean that's what comedians do I would just have to say that I'm not really here to make any judgment on how people decide to express themselves and express their art I'll say that several times I've had my feelings hurt for sure I've had my feelings hurt a lot by Chris but at the end of the day too being in the spotlight it comes with the territory like that is that is the a beautiful response that I don't believe for a second she actually had after it happened yeah how can you believe like anything that they say really when they had uh didn't they have a whole show or at least a huge viral Round Table discussion about how much the entanglement hurt will and hurt his feelings because she had an affair but if they were separated is it really an affair confusing yeah is it still an affair yeah like are they you're still married if you're still married you should not be in other relationships while you're still married I absolutely agree with that but like clearly like from that between them was with the genie in Aladdin yes he was which was like actually didn't go as bad as people thought it was going to go because how do you replace Robin Williams he act poorly like he's uh he's been fine right um also W his and he won his first uh Oscar last year for King Richard the S no one no one cared that he you know committed slapgate they just kind of put that behind them and let him win anyway and he bright which was clumsily made Chris Rock allegedly tried to get with Jana in the middle of one of their separation on and off stages before or after before or after yeah here's what she says I think every summer all the reports would come out that me and will were getting a divorce and this particular Summer she won't clarify which one Chris Rock thought that we were getting a divorce so he called me and basically was like I'd love to take you out and I was like what do you you mean he said well aren't you and will getting a divorce I was like no Chris those are just rumors he was appalled and he profusely apologized and that was that so he felt he felt dissed and he's like now I got to make fun of her hair yeah I think that might be it he was the the burned incel he's just look I I feel uh it was personal I feel bad for the public more than I feel bad for any of them because it just proves that it's all fake I'm sorry what man would be attracted to Jada pinket Smith knowing who she is right yeah especially after the entanglement men that men are into being like maybe guys who like having dominatrix oh Mists think my ego is too big right now let me go to talk down really bad so CEOs you know that's that's true CEOs love that [ __ ] also Leslie Jones recently uh revealed that Chris Rock had to go to counseling after slapgate oh God she said that [ __ ] was humiliating it really affected him people need to understand his daughters his parents saw that he had to go to counseling with his daughters who are 21 and 19 years old that kind of makes them sound like they're in second grade yeah it's also funny because he handled it about as good as you could handle that situation he didn't handle it poorly he just he made a joke about how he's like dude it was a joke bro yeah and like he didn't come out of that situation looking worse so I don't know what he was supposed to do like I don't understand where I mean I guess like who am I to tell him he's not supposed to go into therapy but at the same time I'm like cuz my from what I take from it he took the therapy because he felt emasculated but he handled that situation in a very masculine way I think both of them were emasculated by that would be yeah so what he's saying is that uh maybe if he had done the toxic masculine response which would be to like just drop him yeah um then he wouldn't have needed to go to therapy CU he wouldn't have felt uh emasculated yeah yeah I guess I don't know like what why do we need Logan Paul versus Dylan danis why can't we have Will Smith versus Chris Rock yeah change and it would be funny too because it would end up being for Will Smith because he's probably in better shape and absolutely Chris Rock is like half his size yeah it wasn't a fair fight sure y it also um we uh had the poll today asking you guys who is the worst member of the Smith family Jada it looks like Jada's winning hand but just to be contrarian I voted will because uh he needs to take charge of his his own family you know yeah yep he he's being Jad just because Jaden's annoying and how are mirrors real if our eyes aren't real Jaden J that you know that comment Jaden made it makes a lot more sense when you see that Jada uh had her whole family take iasa trips oh my goodness for like psychic healing wow I did not know about that where were these yeah Jada also revealed in the same interview that she was struggling with suicidal ideation for a long time works for that and that she took iasa and her suicidal ideation ceased but that her whole family yeah her kids has yeah taken iasa I don't know if they did together Psych the kids she made sure we knew they adults when they did this not when they were minors but that's intense yeah way less intense things you can do it makes more sense why Jaden Jaden has this like split Consciousness asking like are our eyes real like full on philosopher now yeah he kind of struggles because it makes him look like a try hard and it's it's kind of embarrassing didn't he want to have like his uh like male genitalia removed at one point wasn't that a thing I'm not Googling that I don't think he did but he said he wanted I just know that he started like wearing skirts and painting his nails like a lot of male celebrities do okay but I don't know if it went as far as like transitioning he was questioning it I believe yeah oh well I mean when you have a male role model like Will Smith in your family like how do you make sense of being a man you know what they do they send him to therapy and they have him watch all of the old Will Smith movies reinforce being it's just it's just reinforce that toxic masculine it's a 20 minute clip of just him hitting the alien in Independence Day goes Welcome To Earth over and over again and they just keep playing that clip Until you realize that your dad's actually pretty cool and then they're like did you know that there's a whole channel in Philadelphia dedicated to the fresh prince of B air your dad did that he wasn't always being you know torn to shreds by your by your emasculating mom jeez bad stuff the whole but this I mean that's like that's why I would never want to be a celebrity right I would never want to have to uh let my family life play out in front of stink bug no no we're under attack I would never want to have my family life play out in front of like the whole world it would be horrible no there's a way to protect your family from it too and they just lean into it and put it on blast Jada is the embodiment of toxic femininity yeah also yeah thankfully red table talk is no longer a thing will should start his own one called black table talk or Blue Table talk or just not red table color I wonder is this the kind of thing where Will Smith was already kind of like this or did Jada infiltrate and was she just one of those women that they warn men about who's kind of like witchy and toxic and plays all these Mind Games to the point where he's just like the way she describes them getting together is she was single Will Smith uh got out of a relationship and then called her saying like who are you dating right now and she said she's single and he said okay you're dating me now so that makes him sound like the alpha in the in the relationship and what it is is it offended that offended her and she played the long game D life well in this interview she she laughs to the interviewer and says can you believe I fell for that oh my God doesn't seem like she likes there also the thing where like when when when she when they had like their like they did like an interview in 2019 where they talk about it's like we don't celebrate our anniversary that's cuz you're barely married anymore but like recently he posted a like it was like last year on her on their anniversary or whatever or her birthday it was on their anniversary like uh he posted some sweet message to her and like two days later she posted a thing about dancing with Tupac like like just emasculating another part of this that's super confusing is that viral video that Will Smith um posted where Jada was recording him in their house yeah and he said like don't record me in my own home like whatever but they apparently were living apart by that point anyway so how does that video even come into existence like it's cuz it's all fake Whole World's fake it's all a stage she really did just want Tupac she she had to she feels like she settled for Will Smith yeah she got with him when he was like the alpha and then once his time passed she was like should have gotten with Tupac all right let's go to super chats shall we DC and C said Empty Chairs really pulled their own they did their work last week ladies and gentlemen you guys weren't here so the empty chairs had to F what we do without we're almost replaced Shane Wilder Shane H Wilder said Mary did you see the latest pints Matt talked with Keith Nester about his conversion and the rosary crew check it out and the rosary crew I pray the rosary with them every day would recommend yeah I was actually watching that this morning uh while I was on the way here I'm not done with it yet but this guy live streams praying the rosary literally every day and has since 2020 which is surprising impressive like I don't know like no one is consistent with like many things so like he filmed like five in a day and just like over the week I hope not no he live streams it so I don't think he' be able to like so so I used to PO I used to skate release a different skating edit every day right I would make a full one minute skating edit that I would have to go out and film in different locations every day now that at that time I was working like 30 hours a week so I had the time to to skate multiple times a day but I would cut up and make several edits so I never missed a day because I would get like anxious if I wasn't skating anyways but I had at any given point 14 edits that could have gone up the next day if I missed if for some reason I couldn't skate that day that never ended up happening but yeah I would like the cont the content back up uh and that's been like the hardest part about being injured is like not being able to skate and like just kind of like are you posting anything on Instagram no no like I I thought about posting old stuff I love seeing your old stuff it's a cool little treat it's like all look at him go I need to I need to do but I I I I ended up skating the mini ramp downstairs last weekend for like 20 minutes and then just felt like my knee is like still too precarious uh it' also be really funny if I got hurt while nobody was here I've fallen just watching you die you need to get light you need to get I've um there like there was a time where uh there was an like there was a time where they were considering like uh an insane system for the mini ramp where it was like if you it was basically like a dead man switch where like you have to like reset it every 10 minutes or otherwise an alarm would go off and I I flat out said I'm like I'm not doing that I'm not doing that why would you have that like so the idea is like if somebody was skating down there alone and fell and then they couldn't get up the alarm would the the dead man switch should probably be on like an hour cycle not 10 minutes well I mean not really because if you're laying there for an hour you're probably dead by the time somebody shows up but I was like I I was like I refuse I'm like if I fall and die so be it there is a there you can do a digital dead man switch where you have to click a link in an email every day or else your family members will get all of your data they do that for plots for movies where it's like if you don't pay this by this he's like he's like and you can't hurt me because I've got an email set to send out at 6:00 a.m. every day unless I cancel it and I'm and I'm like I'm watching those scenes like and that scene passes and I'm like how would you actually set that up is that like a thing no it's like it's a paid service now you can do that sirano production said Johnny Tsunami haha nice decom reference bread I didn't watch I wasn't that wasn't me I just I know who it is but it's like mentioning Johnny Bravo like it's like it's it's pop cultural enough for me to know what it is without ever actually watching it yeah you know I watched it let's hold off on the rest and we will come back after the fact ladies and Gentlemen let's move on I want to talk for just a couple minutes here about what's going on over at Warner Brothers uh and the fact that they could be selling to Universal in the next couple of years which is very very interesting considering they just got sold from AT&T to Discovery like less than a year ago okay I didn't even know that AT&T owned Warner Brothers before that right so what's what's interesting to me about this is like look they can't win we've watched them release project after project in the last year uh and they can't seem to find a footing for anything that works none of the DC movies have really done all that well they're not really doing anything with Harry Potter outside of the theme parks until the new television show comes around but Universal which is owned by Comcast has had nothing but success stories this year so they did Oppenheimer Fast and the Furious um Super Mario Brothers yes uh as well as cocaine bear and Five Nights at Freddy's is about to come out and we were having trouble finding tickets for Five Nights at Freddy's because all the seats were sold out seems like they just know what sells also Puss in Boots The Last Wish uh and what's interesting about like like people mention like how how much money Barbie made with all of this press and all of this like media fervor Super Mario Brothers almost beat like they they barely beat Super Mario Brothers and they did it without any of way less marketing way way less marketing but also way less buzz from like us talking about it right it just proves the strength of the brand for them uh and so Comcast is is at this time the largest media conglomerate in the United States that's like number one next to I think um I had the list it owns the rest of Hulu that Disney doesn't own exactly right so uh like Comcast AT&T Disney Paramount Global and then Warner Brothers Discovery are the are the companies that are the biggest media conglomerates in in America but Comcast also owns um Universal or I'm sorry they own sci-fi Universal CNBC MSNBC uh and then also the Universal Parks which is like that's a lot of stuff to own so one of the things you have to worry about is like look it's going to end up you're consolidating down so far that only a small number of companies own any of these businesses and why would you want to sell the company why would why would um Warner Brothers want to sell right now when it would be at a loss because they haven't been able to bolster their numbers or cut enough weight from their from their books well in this article it says it's because uh Warner Brothers is broke AF right now so y it's a last ditch effort and this is why David zaslav demanded that James gun recast DC with cheaper Talent like David Corn sweat uh as Superman the plan for the original The Flash movie uh was not what we saw they were saying it was going to have a bunch of cameos and set up for movies with Henry caval with Ben Affleck like all the favorites and then they had to change it last minute and it was not what they in visioned at all and what's funny about like if you look at the biggest companies in the world it's Apple Saudi oil and Microsoft oh my God right so there's also talks like they they assume that there's a lot of people that assume that at some point apple is just this enormous Corporation that's going to eventually buy up one of these companies likely Paramount at some point they lend like it's very possible that they could because they have the money their own streaming service is not doing so hot they're kind of insulated the way Amazon is right the the the market cap on on Apple is 2.7 trillion so it's like they have the the cash Reserve you know the TV plus is merely a footnote for them so it doesn't matter that no one watches and and the problem with consolidation is is like uh there there's an article we're going to cover tomorrow that's talking about how the thing that Hollywood really wanted out of this writer strike was to be able to start cutting the the the dead weight from a lot of these companies but what it's going to mean is that a lot less creativity because you're only going to have so many places where you can go to get entertainment and a lot of them are becoming tech companies apple is not a media company it's a tech company Amazon was a a book publishing company turned into a Marketplace and they're becoming some of the largest Distributors of entertainment uh and companies like Comcast when you think about just the size of uh of their operation so if they're running your MSNBC and CNBC so that's your financial news your shitty mainstream press your shitty movies in actually I shouldn't even say shitty they actually made the good uh plenty of the actual good movies that came out this year imagine they consolidate further the same way that um 20th Century Fox got bought by Disney like at one point you had a chance to just go to all of these different places to get your entertainment the old X-Men anybody ever seen the old X-Men movies back in the day very different from the Marvel movies you get now right and I think that's a great way to look at it like back then you got these movies from Brian Singer uh which were vastly different from what Marvel would then go on to make eight years later now all anybody can talk about is how they're going to integrate the X-Men into the already previously established Marvel franchises like do we really want to see what it looks like when we have to have uh Super Mario Brothers vers DC or something like that right like it's it's just not interesting to me uh and it and it stifles creativity uh and oh also they also did um Megan this year I thought that that was a pretty good movie I like that one it's the same Studio that's making the Five Nights at Freddy's movie do really well I like if they're so the idea is like if they're going to have to sell if they if they want to sell Warner Brothers Discovery for an actual like profit they'll have to actually make something that makes money which they haven't seemed Barbie other than no no that was um that was Universal that made Barbie Warner Brothers didn't make Barbie I'm saying Warner Brothers is going to have to have projects that actually make money if they want to sell at a profit and they haven't really been able to do that in the last year is this the type of thing where like do you guys have like we've had this discussion before about like whether men or women have streaming services do you have any streaming services no not really any uh no so like cable but cable was a thing right everyone had cable with a thousand choices uh eventually you're only going to have three or four that you're going to be able to choose from and all of the past stuff that's fine but eventually you're going to start seeing all the entertainment looking the same Brett Barbie is a Warner Brothers no that's what I'm saying you said it was Universal I said it no I don't think so it's it's a Super Mario Brothers was a universal Barbie was a I'm saying that Warner Brothers will have to have something other than Barbie that makes money yeah yes uh everything else Warner Brothers released this year was crap and the only reason I remember that is because Oppenheimer was Universal and Warner Brothers was Barbie and all and it Christopher Nolan used to make all his movies through Warner Brothers and then switched to Universal after the Flop that was 10 I mean I've half jokingly said that I'm just so tired of having to look up where to stream blank show or movie cuz there's like they are constantly switching licensing and there's like two seasons of this show on Paramount plus and then the other two are on this other one and like I'm so tired of searching for where to watch things I kind want a big company to just take over all the streaming services if you guys are looking for the answer to that uh if you go to if you have IMDb you don't even have to have IMDb Pro you can set like what streaming services you have right uh and you can check all and then when you look up a show it lists right under there it says you can find this show at this but you can also use alternative streaming platforms disou all at least uh but also like so if if they're restructuring DC right now and we have James gun making all of these changes they sell to Universal in two years and it just gets rebooted again and then they just start over again that's what would end up happening I mean I want them to just stop altogether making DC movies because I don't like them I know I know Valiant uh they said they're saying sell within two years I know Valiant Renegade said it probably wouldn't be doable in less than three to five but I just uh I want to see in my lifetime both DC and Marvel Run themselves into the ground very plausible I mean at least the the I want to live to see that may not be soon but I want to see it well the the idea would be more that like it would be that they're just less popular now I don't think it's ever going to be that thing where you're like it is now in officially in the ground everyone who has a Marvel tattoo is going to regret it the um I I also wonder if Apple will end up buying par amount or something like that but that would that would kind of signal like a a strategic shift in where they're looking to take the business and I think they've done very well with their you know Avant guard shows on their little streaming service that they probably write off as a loss every year sance is really good that's the only thing I remember liking from Apple TV but well everybody always complains that there isn't enough new stuff coming out but Apple TV actually does seem to consistently put out new stuff that's not the same cookie cutter stuff that we see all the time also Paramount or now that I think about it Comcast also has John like the John Wick movies because those are Universal so that franchise and they just released the show the Continental uh and the Twisted Metal Series so they're all making grow they're all growing and expanding but it just seems that Warner Brothers can't seem to do it and you don't even necessarily have to have uh Max to watch Discovery if you want because you can still watch it on Discovery plus that's so stupid like everything from Discovery plus is on Max yeah but some people just don't have Max yeah so they didn't consolidate them like the less streaming services the better in my opinion it does feel like it's gotten out of uh out of hand lately yeah it's not it's not great but I I got rid of Disney plus I'm not going to watch any of the Marvel shows watch why don't you just bite the bullet and get rid of your all of your streaming services I'm never going to do that why cuz I actually watch cuz I actually watch stuff all I I go through I no CU then I would okay I'll tell you why I'm not going to do that because we won't have to get into that yeah but uh yeah no no don't encourage Brett to cancel his streaming services that I also May partake I had to okay so here's the thing I Expos I think keep them all SAR Sarah once very graciously asked if she could watch some stupid baking show that nobody watches with her um clearly um you know dumb no I'm just kidding was it great Halloween bake off those are probably the only shows that make money now don't the baking shows and the dating shows like these are the these are the shows that actually bring returns I was just watching the newest the newest season of Love is Blind have you guys seen that yet I love that show I haven't seen the new season but it was very fascinating I haven't seen the new season so s Sarah asks to use my my Max subscription but the here's the problem what when I when I go back to checkin CU I started watching Deadwood again and it's not the Great British Bake Off that's destroying my my continue watching list South Park and um Rick and Morty and I will not have Rick and Morty you just exposed Sarah as a Rick and Morty fan you know that is Mor the Halloween baking Championship to Rick and Morty pipeline is real okay so I what I did there was CU like uh I just said like look I don't want my continue watching lists um denig like destroyed with this disgusting different profiles and no so what I did is I made I made a second profile so there's Brett and there's not Brett and I just sent her like a video that just pointed like this me this you I never yeah did not sent I yeah I sent like a video as like me you as if the one that says not Brett isn't very clearly worded in the thing so it's very not in my backyard yes like look you can watch whatever you South Park I'm fine with Rick and Morty not so much but saying like it's like but here's the thing like all my stuff like my there's a a beautiful symmetry to all the things I watch right where it's like it's like uh drama drama drama sure there's some DC animated movies in there but then Rick and mor what is I ruined your perfect algorithm it looked it looked so beautiful before and now now my recommends are changing and it's just I won't have it that's what happens when you're a good person Brett yeah thank you I do pay for my own Amazon Prime that's you ever need it look at that I've got Amazon Prime that's fine that's fine also Amazon Prime is is easily the worst of all the streaming services at least as far as user experience oh user yeah yeah I will give you that but they have some good stuff on there they have a lot of good a lot of good movies there's there's stuff that I watch on there they just have so much money they don't need to care whether their platform is usable or not like uh Netflix is kind of the same right like Netflix is horrible lately it lags really really bad it just stops playing never stopped pissing me off that they autoplay anything you scroll past on yes I hate that you can turn that off on on one of like either on Amazon or on Netflix you can turn that off netx makes like so much of their own stuff that they don't have any good movies when I try to search a movie I actually know or actually like it never Hulu is where you go for that they just want you to watch their shitty shows and movies yeah all right let's go to super chats let's get a crisis party here guys come on out we're almost there Shane H Wilder said Brett was already canceled because of mocha hate wrong he also said hey no talking about photoshops from screen grabs why yeah yeah Shane H Wilder we're not we're not calling out your memes tell me Brett over here thinking all of us pro-life Catholics look alike I see how you are it's honestly bigoted the um it's yeah okay whatever said cute of the day approved there you go yay Papa [ __ ] said pandas old and busted raccoons the new hotness what uh what was it that Andrea Mew she she likes wombat she has wombat Wednesday really she shares like aat every wom bats are adorable there you go we're women Wednesday we Empower women every Wednesday yeah that's horrible idea horrible idea like what are you trying to like the world's already on fire are you just trying to make it worse it's I'm just entertain let's hold off on the rest let's come back after the fact guys let's get a crisis party going huh all right Mary tell us what's going on with Julia Fox and Kanye yes so Julia Fox is yet another female celebrity promoting her new Memoir it's called down the drain I guess that's where Kanye's urine went right down the dra no it went it went into the to the onto the wall so in this Memoir she details the Romantic encounter in which they first met and it has a PE incident okay I'm sorry but I need to tell you this is the first night they met she calls him the artist by the way she doesn't name him in the Memoir she's just you know gesturing toward who it might be the artist starts peeing on the wall and I quickly jump in front of him before telling people outside the club not to take any pictures this is her Valiant moment where she's literally the Secret Service of PE she Shields him from the paparazzi getting getting the pee photos she jumps in front of a man who's peeing well the funniest part not in front of behind is in front of him like he's in a dark alley she's covering the alley so that no one can see him I see I see it's actually really romantic if you think about it no then he gets done he's like wanted them to take that photo I was trying to make it controversial what are you doing and then it says once he Zips his pants back up he puts his arms around me and pulls me in close kissing me passionately bro didn't even wash his hands first that was like all the comments uh on the videos they start talking about this we're debating about like the why did people feel so strongly about this specific account no idea they were very he peed in an alley that's like the worst thing ever it's just like bro like if if you're a dude who's gotten drunk at a bar it's like I'm not like grossed out by him I'm grossed out by her that she wasn't grossed out by it that she's acting like this is like a huge romantic moment between her and a lover it's like you're a gold digger who tried to like get on yeah he put his hands on her face and Whitney and Whitney Houston's I will always love you just played from inside the inside the bar right at that cresendo moment well I think you're kind of right that she's a bit of a gold digger but it's more an opportunity Digger cuz she was saying in this Memoir she wasn't really that into Kanye she was into the opportunities that he might be able to give her if she stays with him despite not really liking him that much um and I think she is doing what his current wife Bianca sorri might do eventually which is turning on him and making him the villain in the story of their relationship she says now that she was simply being used as a pawn in his Grandmaster plan to get back at his ex-wife that's humiliating that's a really shitty position to be in and she also called Kanye a master gaslighter uh essentially accusing him of being abusive without actually saying that which just seems uh misleading and opportunistic yeah she's like playing the victim card now cuz she's lost opportunities for having dated Kanye at this point since his reputation has gone downhill she's now she's associated with him she's kind of cancelled by association and she has to distance herself do you remember this article from 2022 that says Julia fox said she dated Kanye West to get him off Kim Kardashian's case and distract him that's what she said I thought ultimately I'd be helping a precarious situation oh shut up but I learned very quickly that I was being weaponized I felt like his little puppet I feel like he's using me in some weird Twisted game and it makes me feel dirty it's funny cuz she admits to using him yeah they used each other they used each other right exactly so who's the victim nobody no no the by by the modern-day Progressive law of power dynamics she's a woman so she's dumb and stupid that's what that's literally what they're saying they're like she he's got he's got money Fame and more wealth than her and she's a woman so she's dumb that's what that's literally what they're saying she can't handle his master gaslighting so like it's always funny whenever like people kind of horse you around to like uh we we want to help women so much that we're going to pretend like they're invalids which is what they're saying they don't know any better that's what they're saying about Bianca Sor right now the more accurate representation and the more the more empowering situation would say they know exactly what they're doing and even if you disagree with having a transactional relationship with a person as a fully grown big girl adult she's allowed to do that and get whatever she wants out of that relationship because sometimes life isn't as simple as falling in love like a Disney movie especially if you're a disgusting celebrity who's just out to turn every interaction with another human being in your favor y yeah it's it's an insult to women to treat them like children I think that what Bianca sorri is doing with her life right now um is degrading but I think she's doing it on purpose and she doesn't need anyone to save her she's going to learn the consequences of her own actions the way any any adult should MH um she also Julia Fox revealed that Kanye offered to get her a boob job while playing Uno about like two weeks into knowing each other we were spending a day playing Uno in a game that involves highlighting positive words in the dictionary what is this kindergarten I'll get you and sine came up Kanye offered uh yeah kany had given her a top that she said it doesn't look good unless she wears a bra and then he said I'll get you a boob job if if you want ah the romance she said no thanks uh and she said she said it made her uncomfortable okay that's a bit of a loaded word um just offering but um I don't know he was just being a nice gu I offended but I don't know he thinks every chick wants a boob job probably somebody thought it was interesting given that his mom died of plastic surgery oh yeah he was trying to kill her is that what you're that's not what they said but yeah they said it was interesting they said like thought you thought he would be more sensitive to the issue given that his mom died undergoing cosmetic Sur he seems to never learn from his mistakes right because it's like what we love about him yeah like I mean it's almost like a innocence kind of thing in a way but which I actually I don't think it is at all but it's like he keeps dating these women and then acting shock that they only like him for his resources Fame and money and doesn't understand why they keep like leaving him and betraying him and writing these hit pieces or Memoirs actually you know what whatever you call them now so I I don't feel bad for him or her he almost certainly was using this public relationship to do what he thinks is getting back at Kim Kardashian when in reality he was just making himself look worse and making her look like the bigger person she just turned into Super Dad and just become dad of the year who just did like everything for the kids all the time and just make her look like a a greedy work work obsessed like that would have worked narcissis it would have worked for yeah but I I guess their breakup amounted to um Kanye soft ghosting Julia Fox because he got on a phone call with Kim Kardashian where he learned he was so shocked to learn that Julia Fox had had addiction issues in the past and he's like well that's just a bridge too far and Julia said uh I already told you that I had been on drugs before you just weren't listening she does mention a thing there's even like funny he doesn't vet these women at all so well they're talking and he just he's just bring go he's like yeah yeah you're you know you're really smart people underestimate you there was the thing where she said like when when he called like he would mostly talk and I would mostly listen and I laugh cuz it's like of course right he's the Mad genius uh in you're the in you're the the new woman in his life and but she said but when he when I did talk he said yeah all of my points were very interesting and I was very intelligent so he he sprinkled on the compliments as much as he could muster he's like wait like he he probably pays a guy to like stand like awkwardly in the Next Room and listen to what he said what she said and then like write a synopsis that he can read later right it's like she thinks he was she was his Muse but really it was just him thinking about himself the entire time literally any woman should just sat there she is most known for that clip of her being like I was Josh saf's Muse and uncut down uncut I just um she also says her Memoir didn't detail intimate moments with Kanye because their bond was essentially sexless quote it wasn't really about that she's she claims that they never had sex interesting honestly I I would believe that I would believe that yeah cuz if it is advantageous to claim that you did you know she would right it doesn't really make a difference at that point she was waiting for that so she could add the part in the Memoir about how he was sexually aggressive but she can't because they didn't have sex yeah exactly also by the time that they stopped talking Kanye sent her an NDA and said if you don't sign this NDA we can't be friends anymore and she said I'll live boundaries he's got boundaries he also sent ndas to her friends it is kind of obnoxious that she kind of expected him to hire her friends as an Entourage of stylists like he told her that one of the things that bothers him about her is that she constantly brings her friends to everything they do oh have you ever seen that like Tik Tok where the girl shows up to like a date with a guy with like a friend and then and then gets mad when the guy like leaves he's like I'm not kind of like that yeah yeah but he did end up you know employing her friends I'm sorry but it's really funny he put her friends on the payroll it's really funny that if millionaire Kanye West like they come to dinner and he makes like he just splits the check he like he makes like he's like I'll pay for you but I'm not paying for your friends there was that other video where like a guy uh took his girlfriend out for for dinner over over uh like for her birthday and she brought like all her friends and family and he's like I'm not paying for all of these people she get mad about that yeah she got really mad about that and then the girl will be like whatever happened to chivalry yeah no really that's literally what would happen you the neighbors like your dog walker the mailman you know it's it's a scam it's a scam kind of tired of self-interested professional adult women getting into relationships that are essentially transactional and then acting like they're victims after the fact exactly if you want to be in a transactional relationship that's fine but just be honest about the fact that's what you want she didn't get the prize that she wanted at the end because of the fact that Kanye blew up his reputation after the fact she didn't get the cred the street cred in her industry that she thought she would get so when she realized she took the wrong gamble she wants to turn it around and make it out like he was the bad guy she's like now I have to start this stupid podcast to talk to these stupid celebrities she putting out a memoir she's she has the podcast she's doing also a reality show that's kind of like Project Runway she's kind of perfect for that to be honest like in the 2000s this is exactly the type of person who would have ended up on a reality show with a reality show she's she's perfect for that that's like right ruining his reputation didn't hurt her at all in my opinion yeah she's still able to get away like Scotts free and play the victim card and is still getting all these opportunities how do you guys do you guys feel that he's um controlling his uh his new wife oh probably most likely they are legally married yeah we were wrong about that they married they are they're not married are they're legally married at this point yeah I don't know for me personally no amount of money would be worth that but uh it's not if every not even if he puts all your friends and family on the payroll yeah I mean she was already on the payroll before they were even dating she was an employee of his my family right now is like come on Sarah take over the time I don't know what it means that she was his architect for for Yeezy but yeah that's how they met kind of like how Elon meets his baby mamas he's got well those work those workplace things it's just it's it can be can be dangerous if you're if you're Elon but elon's also such a Droid that it's like it doesn't even matter like there's not really much emotion it doesn't feel like like I I wonder what emotions like do does Does Elon Musk have emotional emotionally fraught conversations with Grimes or does he just she's like I'm mad at you he's like what are you mad about well there was that time that Elon posted a tweet saying like pronouns are stupid or something and then Grimes replied I know this isn't your heart call me oh my god oh by the way I have a new i' I've added another phrase to my list of things that don't mean anything and I think more than any more than any phrase out of all of them my heart is so full makes me angrier than anything it's like I get it you're at a wedding I really do hate that now that you mention it I didn't even realize that that was the phrase that like triggers me but yeah my heart is so wasn't there another one that like triggered you nourishing my body I hate nourishing I ha I hate the word nourishing in general but yeah uh nourishing my body is I have a list it's unfortunately like oh yeah stepping into my comment that's I hate stepping into my comments I that it's for a lot of it is like a bunch of a bunch of these got deleted off my off my list of of stuff anything involving my truth taking back my happiness uh be kind know you don't like be kind yeah that's because it's a morphous it doesn't mean anything it's like uh it's nobody's meaner than a person who has be kind in their profile they are the meanest people on on Earth also you see it on school like there's like a there's a school out here that just has it like on the fence of the of the baseball stadium I also really don't like be yourself that was the ubiquitous phrase for children of the 2000s be yourself I don't even know what that means taking back my happiness what I'm re reclaiming reclaiming my happiness yeah you took a creative writing class great I hate congrats I hate all of that it's just it's like say like I'm happy now that's way easier it's just get off Instagram those are all Instagram phrases right it's literally if you if you made an app it's like I'm going to make an inspirational infographic app and it just has like word like phrase suggestion okay now I need to like air my grievances about this new season of Love is Blind because you can really easily tell that all of the women on the show are normies who don't think any deeper than Instagram quotes about self-love like every woman I forgot about okay especially the woman from Puerto Rico that Dane claims he used to know she's one of the worst and she's like I'm perfect I'm I'm so emotionally mature and I have it all together and I just need to find someone who deserves me like this is the language of the dating world right now also all of the women show up like thoughts that are like going out to a night in the club and the men are dressed up for like job interviews like it doesn't make sense anymore men should just start turning the tables and doing that where they just show up with like barbecue sauce on their shirt like half the shirt is tucked in half the shirt isn't just dress like Adam Sandler a woman who can handle all of this like no these men are dressing up for dates where the women can't see them I mean granted they're on TV so a lot of people are going to see them but still yeah most of the women were just like touting selflove phrases like I'm ready to date because I finally have accepted myself and learned to love myself and I've been in I've been in bad relationships before because I didn't love myself enough and all of the men were evil toxic narcissists never the it's like it is Taylor Swift syndrome if you've dated 33 guys and they will sabotage their own relationships and then blame the guy or self-pity about it afterwards like this one girl was on the verge of getting proposed to by this guy and decided to finally drop this bomb of information on him that she has been divorced like on one of their like they're pretty far along in the process and then she's like by the way I got divorced is that okay with you and he's like uh no and then she goes to throw a pity party about it like he doesn't accept me for me well there isn't really a thing that a woman could a woman could literally be like look I went to jail for murder in the 80s and and then and then she she like that's okay right and the guy would be like no that's not okay I don't date women who have been uh who have been uh you know in prison for murder I guess they just insecure huh if you can't hand me at my best you don't at my worst you don't deserve me at my oh I have to add that one too that one that's a good one they're like What's your body count and they're like well I've killed two people yeah it's anyway let's go to Super Chat do so fun Steven Ellis said bucket list pee outside on all seven continents okay that's a go I believe in you we believe in you yeah yoshima otaru said I bet will didn't know they were separated oh that's even worse she's like look I'm going to sleep at this house you're going to sleep at this house but we're still together their mansion is so big they could be separated in the same house right there's a $20 one there from retro uh I don't even know how to pronounce that retral yes this show is my selfcare as I reclaim my truth and do better I'm finding my authentic self and stepping into my happiness as I follow my heart thank you for being amazing humans that was rock on very good refund that based fund that Queen I got to go I'm out of here you got to go to therapy after that one that was that that's another thing is is people who oh yeah that was another thing in Love is Blind the all of the chicks when they were asked what kind of guy are you looking for the first thing they all said in unison was like he has to be in therapy oh my gosh because men are all inherently broken individuals who need to fix themselves from their inherent maless but no that's the problem the women also believe that the the women also are all in therapy as well so they're saying like if I'm broken if I'm broken in need therapy it's not possible that somebody else isn't also wait okay if they're in therapy how have they never introspected in their [ __ ] life ever before going on a reality TV show yeah that's what I'm wondering these therapists are not doing that at therapist like maybe the reality show isn't a great idea the therapist is not telling them to be introspective the therapist is telling them that everyone around them is the toxic narcissist that's the problem and that's keep them in thery exactly keep them broken 200 watt Studio said if you put the seat down then you can't see the art what what like P art or something if you put this uh Shane H Wilder said as a photographer I wouldn't do that on a first date at that point it's not a date it's a photo shoot true yeah like but also you're taking photos of her for her Tinder profile for after she ghosts you there's a certain amount of like there there's a well cuz no cuz it looked like a video too it's like there's a certain amount of like um the guy should just realize like maybe like how much do I care if the girl I'm in is like an is like insanely into herself and terminally online because if she's asking me to do this on a first date that shows like a certain like lack of understanding of what your priorities are supposed to be in like certain social situations what about a second dat so that's kind of actually on him in a way to be like maybe this isn't the best like I I don't remember what I didn't even see what the lady in that thing looked like but but like even if she's really pretty maybe you should tell yourself like maybe this isn't the person I'm looking for he also has to take responsibility because like likely it's not going to get any better from there it's probably downhill yeah dcnc said Dr romani's podcast on narcissism is funded by Jada what a supreme irony oh that's weird really I listen to that chick sometimes cuz she I mean just smart sounds uh she did a she did an interview with um Evan Rachel Wood Rec yeah about Manson J or Dr Dr Romani okay and I was like when I was watching it CU she's like uh C we we we did it on we we looked at it on the stream with Colonel kurts last Friday and it was interesting the way she's like she's kind of like re oh oh also affirming someone I hate that phrase as well but she's like kind of like affirming everything that she's saying and I'm like I wonder because assuming that like in these situations where she can't really know if she's telling the truth or not you're really just taking someone at their word would she be will to would she be willing to allow man in the same leeway to like if he was like yeah and that's when she did this and she like oh yeah yeah like would she be willing to reaffirm everything he says as well in the s for the sake of um you know being fair to both parties but it didn't really seem that way Papa [ __ ] said there's no way will'll we'll hit him he's too much of a wuss is what she was actually thinking that's funny yeah she's like I'm going to finally prove myself to her after 12 years of marriage maybe she'll take me back how that go for you will let's hold off on the rest and let's come back after the fact shall we Mary tell us what's going on with Johnny Somali not tsunami there is a US streamer named Johnny Somali who has been arrested in Japan after trespassing and just generally harassing and threatening the public on public transport and it included a a threat of nuclear war he this is not a joke this I'm not exaggerating he he threatened that they were going to Nuke Japan again I'm going to read people on public transport he also entered one of their female only train cars which they have in Japan because there is a huge problem of sexual harassment and groping so the females have to go in their own public trans there's a $20 one here from David Christian says finally caught a bit live again usually watching at work 3:00 a.m. why years why did Will Smith slap Chris Rock Why seven I maybe meant seven years s like why did uh why did he slap Chris Rock yeah it's uh's we're not going to ever know get my get my like um common law divorced wife's name is that is that thing if you're if you're married at seven years is common law right or if you're together for seven years common law separated for on you are get my common law divorced ex-wife's name out out so funny um but yeah so what I love about this is that Japan is extremely hard on crime which is why people fawn over it saying it you always feel like you're safe in the streets like there's it's clean you don't Litter there like you will get jumped if you litter in Japan wild and uh Japanese government don't you know let people out on good behavior they don't have parole and they have a 99% conviction rate yeah so he's been arrested he's been detained he's likely going to get possibly three years in prison I'm going to read this what what Asia what this um tweet said a Japanese government will hold him for 28 days uh in those 28 days they will use sleep deprivation tactics and hours upon hours of interrogation to break his mind and force him to confess his crimes of trespass I'm laughing because it's very gu I'm laughing because streamers have proven themselves to be like public threats like streamers are Public Enemy Number One we just the government needs to take action because like mizy is allowed to just run rampant in the UK invading people's homes jumping people for entertainment value and he doesn't get any consequences but we here in America have a beautiful thing called the Second Amendment where if you just show up to a guy at the in Virginia uh the the [ __ ] around and find out scale gets yeah did you guys see that there's this prank YouTuber that got shot while he was I heard about that approaching someone to prank them oh yeah I did actually hear about that and the guy got acquitted I feel like this is the backlash against all streamers in general yep and it's well needed in my opinion they just think that they can get away with anything um and then he says once he confesses uh they will sentence Johnny to 3 years in prison then they will Deport him back to America once he finishes his sentence there is no early or good behavior parole in Japan Deco voice said what if they deported him to Somalia instead yeah wait is he actually Somalian or is he American he's he's American okay and then he made a follow-up video uh after threatening people on public transport but let's show that that video first here we go youim this guy is so unlikable you know H Aima you know why you do this for Harbor oh my Goda nagaki Yes Man [ __ ] yesima if he was in New York he would just get dropped yep people in Japan are so polite and like patient and non-confrontational like it's just like their culture so if this was anywhere else he would have gotten hirosima Nagasaki you know why to you [ __ ] Hiroshima Nagasaki we destroy it because you [ __ ] don't know how to [Music] behave I swear to God you do it again we're going to we're going to do it again you understand understand yeah I don't know what the prank is other than just being a dick that's it being annoying and not funny hypocrite like fix your behavior while he's the one screaming at them the ironic part is like if you do things like this on public transport in New York you actually won't get consequences because people are similarly just like the mindset is don't get involved the mindset is if you get involved you will end up getting charged not the person who is instigating it yeah I was just thinking that reminds me of a Bart like writing Bart like on the on a daily basis like in in the Bay Area we have BART Bay Area Rapid Transit and it's pretty much like that and there's a lot of weirdos on there you don't make eye contact I took the b a few times it's um it was there was some weird not be so bad it's gotten really bad there was there was I mean even back then there was some weirdos yeah um but it's like almost I guess because we're desensitized to it now it's like one thing but there it's like they actually press charges because it's they don't want it to become a thing yeah well that's what they talk about in this article is like they're they have to to push back against stuff like this so that people don't get the idea to just come here to try and become famous I guess technically what he's being charged with is because he he trespassed in a construction site in Japan that was the technical charge um but he followed up this video from public transport continuing his troll he says that uh his rant on the train was meant to help President Joe Biden get reelected as he is coming to Japan to attend the G7 Summit that month quote so in order to help my president and help his reelection campaign I decided to bring some publicity to the events that happened 80 years ago it was actually patriotic a little bit to bring awareness to the tragedy because Joe Biden is coming and and Joe Biden needs our help and then he also finished a video saying I'm converting to transgender I'm joining the lgbtq plus HDTV community and I'm doing this so we could get cancel culture on my side we are going to turn to transgender because I feel if you can't beat them in this day and age you have to join them so I am part of the lgbtq HDTV plus Community how can you guys really cancel me love the idea of just tcid admission that you just get beaten into submission these days like I can't beat him I'm just giving up I'm just I've just decided to join them I guess he's just trying to be edgy but in order to like make an edgy joke you have to have a punchline as well like you forgot the funny they also they mentioned um Logan Paul's very um Logan Paul did same [ __ ] yeah he was in Japan screaming like running through the streets being an absolute new than filming a dead body and no one talks about that anymore like he totally got away with that the law he yeah he had a severe and continuous lapse in judgment write that one down we just uh the this it'll never go away because there's always going to be an incentive for people to do stupid things in the s for the sake of Fame for the sake of becoming famous that's what der Hunter was saying on the show like you can be in the middle of an intersections smearing feces all over yourself and if you get attention it's a good thing mhm there's no distinguishing between good and bad attention now and uh like look at the um I wonder how the the climate activists who get like uh get you know throw stuff on paintings or sit in the middle of the road feel about like them well at least they feel they have a reason other than a self- serving one they're delusional at least they feel like they're they're doing something to help the world what is actually worse that or the people who are just doing it to you know um ice cream's so good the NPC streamers are at least doing that in the privacy of their own homes in New York there was those people in New York doing it out on the street there's people in New York just doing it out in public I don't know which is worse is it worse when you know you're just doing it for clout and fame or is it worse when you you're doing it and patting yourself on the back what keeps you I probably hate the people patting themselves on the back more but but some people just want to watch the world burn and Johnny Sali is one of them him and you know what's going to be next right he's going to have a collab with mizy yeah and that they'll uh they'll do something together they'll do a thing where they both I want him to go on Pierce Morgan next that would be great and maton Evan get get shamed by Piers Morgan maton Evan hasn't really done anything wrong though I know that's why he's awesome he just kind of shows up at places that you wouldn't expect him to be but he doesn't do anything criminal and standing for landlords was the funniest thing that happened in all of 2023 love landlords it really was um also there's a community note on this post saying uh there is video evidence of Johnny streaming his crimes people gathered evidence of all the crimes he has committed so doesn't look good for him yeah do do you think this is something that we can kind of Shame out of the culture to like at a certain point actually I don't think it's possible too right because they used to talk about how like they would keep W like women would go into to porn and make a bunch of money but you like the culture of Shame around it kept women from wanting to go and do that for work but now the popular female streamers on Twitch are the like titty streamers hot tub streamers yeah all the runchy [ __ ] and then the popular male streamers on those platforms are just criminals cuz they can't capitalize off of sexuality they have to capitalize off of committing Crim it's harder to be us being entertaining it's harder to be us it really is uh you know you're not born with it uh you got to you got to go find unfortunately for the rest of the world that means we have to go out and be like and put upon the rest of the world whereas you guys don't uh you guys can do so from your own room whereas like the guys have to go out and oh or I mean the the the the white pill upside to that is like the ones who actually create interesting content and that's just uh harder to do and takes longer and a lot of times it's just easier to go and and say what's your body count to somebody right the street interviewers have gotten out of control I like it you guys agree yeah like the chicks who are like what would you rate me those those chicks those people I don't know there was uh there was the on it was like what is like what is like a red flag you like in a guy and all the women's answers it's like I couldn't tell if it was like very cleverly edited cuz it's like like the first one is it's obvious it's some like oh when he's like uh uh like when he's kind of controlling or something gen like it's not a nice thing to to be attracted to but whatever but then it cuts to Clips where I don't know if he's actually asking them that question and one girl's like yeah alcoholism she's like yeah like when he's like an alcoholic no he asks the first one like this the what like red flag do you find attractive the other ones he just asks like what are red flags so like but then he cuts it inward it's like she's like yeah I like it when he's uh but there was the one was like at some college campus it was like the one girl like just like very very casually said like when he hits me and the guy is like huh okay if anyone needs therapy it's her yeah dude but like yeah like it's like and I think a lot of it now is like it's becoming like a weird type of like on the spot performance art for these girls who are just like they probably don't even feel that way they're just saying they rehearsed it in the mirror this morning and they were like oh finally a street interviewer and I get to give the most ridiculous answer ever like uh you know like it's just the way it is like it's the the internet culture is like I want to make something that's going to be remembered like the girl who did the thing where she goes like a GU like the uh I had a sugar daddy who paid me to remember that one oh oh to pee on it yeah and then and then he was my no no she she said um did she say 10K she said it was 10K and it turned out to be her professor professor and I was like where are professors even tenur professors getting 10K and I'm just picturing like does she not have like a dad or a mom at home who are going to be like but I guess like no or the the answer is no or the mom is like look uh the mom is desperate to be seen as young like her daughter so she's like yeah go get it's always the moms who are supportive of the only fans Pages you never hear what the dad thinks yeah I know yeah that really skinny girl um the famous one that dresses up she eugia Cooney enaer mom yeah every time like she looks great like all the trans kids enabler mom Jennings so many yeah red flag moms out there yeah awful y it's the way it is all right let's go we got a couple of super chats here guys um Derek null said she said yes to will to make pav jealous who who is that Pac like Tupac mean Tupac uh likely means likely means Pac but yeah like um and all these years later she's going through like um she's going through like a buyer remorse she ended up with I guess it wouldn't matter anyway maybe if I had been with him he wouldn't have been in that car that night and you know that's really what it is she just blames herself for tup Box's death that's her problem I mean that's probably what he'll end up saying she'll she'll write it in her in her next Memoir she's like and really and I tortured myself for years and then and in true like Modern Woman Fashion she like but I finally let go of all of the guilt I put upon myself I'm like no put some guilt upon yourself it's okay to be to to not not forgive yourself for everything like a woman like I cheated on my husband of of 10 years took the kids and you know he had to go sleep in a blowup mattress and eventually offed himself but I've forgiven myself for for what I did I've let it go I've had to forgive myself for the sake of my kids did the work and I'm like and I'm just like no you don't need to forgive yourself you can you can feel guilty that's fine like we could all do with a little more shame in this culture Shane H Wilder said Rosary crew is literally live every day at 5 Central prayer intentions are taken in the chat oh nice I like the idea that you just like immediately after PCC ends you go to Rosary crew tacti platty said Brett do you remember the X-Men made for TV movie Generation X from the 90s tacti platty Farms remembers I do not I I do not remember that one there's there's probably some really good there there have been some gifts that I've seen that were from stuff that I didn't didn't recognize so that could be what I'm what they're from Papa [ __ ] said we were in a limo and he asked if I had a lighter I said yes I don't know if I want to say it that's that's I I thought that was going in like the Barack Obama Direction the the CD yeah like the CD case thing you know the CD case of [Laughter] meth yeah also is Papa [ __ ] is that Hassan P's dad I inquiring minds want to know or is it chank is it well that's his uncle right yeah right there's a there was um a GU like a where I lived in Minnesota there's like an insurance guy like a couple that had like an insurance company and they'd have the bus benches and the guy looked just like Jen yuger and this guy's benches got handlebar mustaches on all of them from some brave soul who like and I made sure to check no other person who had like a an insurance

5,"so Andrew Tate recently made a video denigrating all Canadian men saying you cannot claim to be a man if you are from Canada and Drake was instantly very offended by this I'm sorry but this this is the type of stuff as as awful as you may think uh Andrew Tate is I I'm of no opinion as we all know this is the stuff he's hilarious at yeah it's made for Internet it's it's really funny here's the video imagine being from Canada by the way we're going to get clipped on the music can already tell imagine saying I'm a man from where from Canada what that doesn't go together who are you talking about wait you're a man from Canada just doesn't make sense you know he gave um $200,000 to to Palestine for victims didn't I mean it makes sense right like he's he's Muslim now yeah right so so Drake was pissed and Drake is just getting it on all sides recently yeah so Drake left like a shady comment I don't really know what it means he just said green light um on that clip he felt some type of way about that he's been go mode lately um well Drake is Drake is taking time off now to deal with gastrointestinal problems he said so well he just he just put out a new album right but now he say he's out of the studio for at least a year because of gastro he's tour I have no idea if that means he's going to tour he's not going to record new albums him having stomach problems is very female coded like you can have them but maybe don't admit it like say like taking time off for something else yeah I got to recollect and and like rethink my vision that sounds better than I have gastrointestin just does yeah just does say it's house arrest anything um also there was recently a clip of Joe Buon not Biden uh denigrating Drake's new album saying you know I've seen enough from Drake he's trying to act like he's younger than he is um look it's a he's got a he's making music for young people not for say that you could say that about Taylor Swift she makes music for 22 year olds when she's 33 yeah I guess like all artists have a demographic like that's fine I don't know what Drake's demographic is it's kind of just globalist music that you hear in commercials no no so so point out so like it's it's music for um for Spotify it's literally designed to be what do you like Spotify Spotify what movies do you like Netflix yeah it's that do you want to play the clip of him going off on Drake or is it the in the TMZ article uh can you resend it to me actually I don't think uh I don't think I have that here I just sent it to you yeah we can and this this angered Drake and he left an essay under the video uh eviscerating Joe Buon for failing at his rap career can you resend it I did did did not send oh um here there we go all right yeah let's watch the clip here this one's really funny his I really like the couches that they're sitting on by the way $10,000 couches this is like he rapping for the children and that's my yo dog I had to look up how old this was when I finished listening to the album you are 36 your I want his locks hat though days in 20 days I Googled that too you will be 37 years old get the [ __ ] away from some of these younger and stop [ __ ] these 25 year olds Leonardo DiCaprio is like I will not I I'm confused just because Drake is in his mid-30s dating women and in their mid 20s what's wrong with that it's like could be worse he could be messaging Millie Bobby Brown when she's 14 yeah like talk about that don't talk about the 25y olds talk about the 14-year-old that he was texting please I'm listening to the album he mentioned it why are you still [ __ ] the 25 year olds you're a 37 year old billionaire I get it that you appeal to the world when St current I get it that you part of that is don't want to grow but that's what I'm loving about Cole like my [ __ ] is happening in Reverse like with Cole he used to rap about kid [ __ ] I'm a grown ass like real Jersey City I don't want to hear how you lost your [ __ ] virginity and started to grow up mhm and then the rapping sounded like an adult rapping I'm want to hear adult Drake rapping for adult people no you're not going toar that's my issue uh but it doesn't matter cuz he's making money the way he's making money right now right so he does not need to actually change his style but that's because like an artist like jcole might lean more heavily into the Artistry of rap music whereas Drake is more of a he's marketable he's a marketable and he's a he's a m like he puts on on large scale shows at Large Scale venues now a lot of these other artists do too but they're just they're appealing to different demographics that's not a I don't actually get what the problem is here but it is funny that Drake's response is super sensitive I think like and Drake's response was like he he he did kind of like if we're going to pretend like power dynamics matter like Drake is the D Drake is the one with all the power who like eviscerates this dude so here's what he said you have failed music you left it behind to do what you're doing in this clip cuz this is what actually pays your bills for any artist watching this just remember you are watching a failure give their opinion on his idea of a recipe for Success a quitter give their opinion on how to achieve longevity you switched careers because the things that pop into your brain had you broke living check to check and the RS you write had 450 men showing up to your shows in Dusty NYC jeans to screw up their face to mood mood music 29 and pretend you are the goat please to any artist that's doing what they feel is right don't let these opinions affect your mindset after the fact this guy is the poster child of frustration and surrendering you retired and we never hung up your jersey we don't even remember your number we know you for doing this you withdrew from rap not cuz you accomplished all you need to it's cuz it wasn't working for you I never want anybody in the generations to think that the whole everybody's entitled to their opinion is a real thing this is a man projecting his own self-hate And the fact I did and continue to do everything he wanted to do for himself if you need it if if you need it put in simpler terms I own a 767 he owns a modest house in the 973 and flies first class on special occasions the special occasions part was hilarious I'm sorry like he he got him I don't think but I think that maybe Joe budon was saying this because Drake gave a shout out to Kai sonat the uh twitch streamer that kind of seems like he's trying a little too hard to appeal to gen Z but what else is he supposed to do like if if you go out of your way to appeal to older people then you're called out of touch yeah that you're not developing with the times it's like he it's him in place where he can't win but he wins either way so it doesn't really matter and it's I but at the same time it is funny that Drake would even respond because he doesn't need to if you're so booked and busy what what are you doing in the Instagram comment section on a podcast but that's great like that's what's funny about like he doesn't need to respond okay and who else didn't need to respond aelia Banks she uh saw this clip and said does Drake know his nose job and lipo suction is not hip-hop does Drake know that no one who actually understands hip hop a culture born from oppressed don't really care about his soft tooth colonized confused mixed race faximile attempts to exhibit the true authenticity of an actual MC does Drake know his desperate attempts to gangsterizm compassing failure in and of itself I mean I don't know if that's what I don't know if that's a fair characterization of what he's trying to do but I would say calling anything that he's done a fail and that's some who's not a fan of of Drake but calling him a failure is not really applicable regardless of whether aelia bank's takes are ever correct or incorrect she's just so like verbose and articulate you know like she's so good at articulating them in a way that makes it sound like she's right she also said Can can hip hop get any more trashy does Birdman know how low IQ tacky and how much of an effing loser he looks threatening Joe Buon via the Internet he they they could all learn from that right that doing it like doing those types of threats online always come off kind of cheesy yeah and she also ended the statement saying honestly if Drake's mother was black he'd probably not be so corny white mom syndrome is very real then she took shots at Kanye do you want to get into that like that that clip that came out of Kanye calling cardi B an industry plant really pissed off iselia Banks as well uh she said just when you want to defend Kanye he goes and does some [ __ ] that is just stupid has no comedic or artistic value and I cannot Ste stand to see a beep mfer try and be a bully is Kanye mad at cardi because he has 60 Ghost Riders and none of them have topped bodak yellow I mean that's not that's just not true um so she I I just I appreciate that she always inserts herself into drama and has an extremely articulated opinion about it when she's not involved I also want to point out that one of It kind of reminded me like Drake leaning into what he's doing makes sense because he got made made fun of for the fact that he didn't grow up poor he got made fun of for for pretending like he grew it like started from the bottom with on Degrassi yeah like you he didn't so so is he supposed to lean away from that no he's like he's just he's turned into his own image of himself that's very very um successful so I I told you that Juicy J was talking about um rap sales are down 40% this year we need to have a big meeting to talk about it and turn this industry around um do you think that's because all of the rap world is kind of mesed in drama right now or is it Tik tok's fault uh I mean I would need no because I would need to look at the numbers what what does he mean does he mean sft does he mean does he mean album sales are down does he mean streams are down because I guarantee you streams aren't down people are streaming music more than they've ever streamed before now if we're talking about the fact that perhaps they're making less money because as the industry changes over and more people choose to stream music rather than buy it and so they're automatically they already get so little of the of the 99 Cents or 149 that comes through per sale when you have a record label but then you talk about how little they get in relation to streams like what three cents a stream or something like that like I I would need to look at what they mean by the numbers like that but I would guess that all music genres are struggling right now as long as they're connect Ed to major labels which take the brunt of the profit for this but none of them want to break away and do the marketing themselves and do all of the the leg work because it's an look at how much work it is for Tom McDonald to release an album and a music video it's an insane amount of work for one H one person to have to take on with just a small group of people there's just a very big reward on the other end so they make their choice they stick with the labels and that sucks but but someone as big as Drake doesn't feel feel the the consequences of those things no but there's only so there's only so many that are that big and it ain't that artists and and there aren't that many artists that are actually like that I do like watching um like rap artists fight with each other it's it's just it's just funny because I I did grow up in the 90s when it was actually like what was going on with like the East Coast we West Coast rap Feud where people were actually dying and being shot and now it's justr that stuff still happens but it just doesn't happen in you know the mainstreams is obviously very very different from that but like yeah like now they're now people are arguing with each other I mean that kind of got replaced by unfortunately rappers dying of drug overdoses instead like Lil peep XXX tentasion juiceworld like that that's what replaced yeah those those types of Mac Miller mhm that's that's the sad fact of the matter is I guess that's more of the uh we become vehicles of our our own destruction rather than gen Z is fighting with their own demons well we've me and you have talked about that before because we we've talked about whether it's possible do you think that gen Z is because we've talked about like genz drinking less than previous generations I do think they're doing as many drugs as other Generations because their drug of choice is weed no I think that the that you would look at the numbers and that like we it's more like legally medicated than any other generation prescription it's been uh so they've been more legally medicated and I I think when I see a lot of when I see a lot of videos of like these activists at these events and they're like they're throwing soup on a freaking on a on a painting like I see a lot of that stuff and I believe that they believe what they're they're pushing I if there's someone in in a mental institution with schizophrenia who's under a delusion you also believe that they believe what they're say no but what I'm saying is I also believe that a lot of it has to do with drug use and that a lot of people wouldn't do the things that they were doing if they weren't taking their uppers in the morning their mood stabilizers in the afternoon they're downers when the anxiety kicks in um and I understand how hard it is to get away from that as somebody who like that's not me being unsympathetic I understand that one of the hardest things in the world to break away from is uh a cyclical life full of uh prescription medications that get you through the day um and unfortunately it can also kind of push us into to bad territory when we have you know oh I misspoke uh XXX tentasion got sh I was I was wondering about that I was like when you said that was that Gang Related um so like but Mac Miller MC Miller is the one that I think of when I think of because it's not just that it's actors too like there's actors that die of drug overdoses uh the dude from The Wire died of of a of a fental drug overdose and that guy who who sold him the Angus Cloud also eor like he all fenel right like that's the big problem right so yeah in a lot of ways a lot of rap artists and a lot of actors maybe it's just performers in a lot of ways uh I always make the joke and I'm half kidding when I say it but it's like like actors are like they have to access a lot of emotions so they have to be more naturally emotional people I think in a lot of ways which is why perhaps they're all more leftist and and easily manipulated by political agendas that's just my theory I don't whether that's true or I can't prove that but you know so people who are you know more in their feelings you know cope and I'm I was the same way before we close this segment I need to give uh tribute to aelia Banks's best quote ever uh I believe that when you are fat everything you say or think is underlaid by the fact that you are fat any advice given or idea raised comes with the asterisk of obesity signaling that you hate Beauty and have made your body a monument to ugliness and are dying as a consequence how do you feel about that based thanks for watching listen to full episodes of Pop Culture crisis on Spotify keep up with us on social media and make sure you

7,"Larry Charles is the director responsible for the atrocity that is Dicks the musical it came out a few days ago only in Select theaters I haven't seen it available near us so we can't exactly hate watch it and hate review it for you guys I didn't go see Bros I'm definitely not going to see this we didn't see Bros we didn't see bottoms which was also another so let me queer movie that came out this year Bros dicks and bottoms is the names of the movies these are all movies they're reaching they're reaching very less than a year from mhm they're doing really good work on the naming stuff it's very accessible right it's very yeah so to give you a summary of dicks the musical it's sort of like a queer version of The Parent Trap two self-obsessed businessmen meet each other and realize that they are actually identical twins and they have to get their divorced parents back together um it sounds awful Megan the stallion is in it uh um we're going to talk about that I want talk ler his comments Larry Charles has had the most unhinged things to say about this movie first of all he made a shout out to Trump supporters antivaxers and 911 truthers telling them that this is the movie for them oh before that we have a $20 we have a $20 Super Chat here from fresh meet 999 says happy Sunday Bert if you if you think live laugh love plaques are the devil my sister is the final boss with home family with home family love laugh live Plex also happy Tuesday to the wonderful Mary so it says his sister's the home boss is the final boss of the home family live laugh love but he says love laugh live is that wait are those different things is live laugh love one company and love laugh live is a different company like I like the idea that there's three and they're all separate uh okay let's uh play this video of Larry Charles okay here we go in his basement it looks like are you a trump supporter are you an antivaxer maybe you're a 911 truther or sympathetic to the January 6th Patriots do you believe in a God that hates homosexuals hi I'm Larry Charles and have I got a movie for you I directed a new film called Dick the musical regardless of your police system do you love to laugh do you love comedy do you love movies with catchy songs that you can sing along to no then you'll love Dick's the musical too the Tor Swift movie might have some good songs but there's not much comedy Oppenheimer might have some comedy but I didn't hear any catchy songs didn't really say the comedy and the musical provides this form of entertainment it doesn't matter what you believe it doesn't matter what you think or feel or love or hate or believe in even if in your wildest dreams you never thought you would you will love dicks the musical the most anti-woke woke movie ever made but also the most woke anti-woke movie ever made so Come Ye proud boys so what's what's funny about proud boys and ye oathkeepers and ye Christian evangelicals see dicks the musical the true sound of Freedom opening October 6th what's funny is like when he's not making the obvious references to like right-wing stuff the actual idea of making a movie that everyone can enjoy is actually something that should be celebrated and what they should actually be trying to do but they shouldn't be trying to do it ironically and one of the most muddled descriptions of a movie ever nothing he's like when he gives that description of it he's appealing to No One someone in the chat said he definitely has the crazy look down yeah he looks like uh someone who would be ranting and raving on the street his sarcasm actually highlights the problem with Hollywood right now if he was saying that seriously the part in the middle about this is for everyone one of the most disturbing parts of this movie it sounds like is that the twins end up confusing the phrase love is love to mean that um as brothers they should get married in an incestuous marriage I learned this in an article titled dicks calls God a gay slur and its makers are ready to be hated for it um so they have a whole musical sequence where they call God a homophobic slur I'm not going to repeat the lyrics um it doesn't sound like this is made for a Christian audience well this is this is but here's what he said that I found compelling he said um making fun of a movie with a moral is something we wanted to play with I miss comedies that don't feel message driven Austin power hours Zoolander airplane with crazy characters just delighting you there's been so many straight guy versions of that so it's great we get to do a queer version where the absurdity is the point the problem is by by doing that it's automatically message driven by default you can't there unfortunately like I get what he's saying but you he he doesn't realize that by making it that it's it's already that by default you can't do anything about it the movie is already message driven by default because it's baked into the premise of the film The other thing that's funny is he says it's offensive and gross but it's also campy and bombastic and absurd he said none of this is real the first joke in the movie is that they are twins and they just aren't this whole effing cartoon and it's funny because he talks about how it's funny he talks about how it's absurd but I don't think that this would be allowed if it was the if if it was somebody else making the jokes it's only allowed because they're making the jokes it's honestly surprising that something so a product so unfunny could come from someone that was involved in the making of Seinfeld or Cur Your Enthusiasm I don't really like Borat but a lot of people do and he he was the director of Borat those things actually did have some like actually offensive jokes that landed this is just essentially playing into what's already the status quo which is making fun of religion making fun of Christians because they're the only group that will take it and making something that is directed toward a queer audience so it says this is Sati satirical absurdist deeply seal uh deeply silly rated queer musical inspired by The Parent Trap uh he says before the film's theatrical run kicks off on Friday it's not to be taken seriously it's all in good fun and people certainly seem to be enjoying it so so far the problem is it's only allowed to be all in good fun because it's on your terms uh and if somebody else was to say otherwise or to make jokes that you would find offensive you would not agree with it and you would say that it's a phobic of some sort that's the problem he's making this ironic video like if you're right-wing if you're a Christian if you're Evangelical this movie is for you but he's saying that tongue and cheek because he's he is intentionally provoking Anor instead of provoking laughter from these groups he's not trying to bring everyone together he is trying to alienate these people he's trying to make a movie for a very insular group of people that live in the major cities holding the rest of this country hostage and that's why I think the limited theater release for this movie did well it was being released in the big cities where all of the Liberals and gay best friends of the world are going to go support it do you think that his idea that the movie isn't message driven is like his fumble there is a sign that he just doesn't understand how how much of a message is delivered through what is called queer Cinema or do you think that he's just being dishonest cuz to me it's it's it's plain as day that it is message driven just by the nature of the the of the film's themes yeah I lean toward he's being dishonest more than he's just out of touch because he's made funny material before or at least been involved in projects that were genuinely funny here's his statement about being offended by big budget film he said politically for me ethically for me I find it offensive when movies cost $250 million and the world is in the state that it's in so I'm also looking to make a statement in the way these things are made he uh is critical of what he calls the media Monopoly system in the United States quote kind of an authoritarian Big Brother sort of thing that they figured out over the years they don't have to scare you they have to seduce you so we're all seduced by great TV shows and great movies and we're distracted by these things and we're then indulging in that same capitalist system and there's no way it's going to change as long as we do that I struggle with that it's that's he's absolutely right but he promotes it by being a part of it that's the funny part about you say he's right for the wrong reason I he's right for the wrong reason so he's absolutely right that they distract you with movies and entertainment that's why they're called bread and circuses right uh in a lot of ways he's not wrong about all this I laugh at the idea of him getting to decide what the ethic what the level of Ethics are for the budget of a movie as a guy he's worth $100 million at what point does a guy worth $100 million start to question the ethics of his own net worth arguably you could say that a movie that cost $250 $250 million to make as stupid as it might be to make a movie that costs that much when they all seem to have no return on investment feeds a lot more families than the hundred million that he has will make him sitting in an Investment Portfolio or in his various bank accounts right the $250 million that these companies invest in these movies pays for the drivers pays for the actors pays for the stage designers pays for the costume designers pays for all these people who need to make a living and that's the actual beauty of capitalist systems the problem is it's in an industry that doesn't seem to care anymore about whether that huge investment you know yields a strong return for them so it's just it makes no sense after the failure of bros why would you try to make another movie that is just targeting an audience that comprises what 5% of the population and he does like his his kind of his him decrying all this he almost gets that Indie would be the way to go for him but these people don't want to anyone in the Hollywood mainstream they don't want to actually be the ones risking their own money to make their message driven movies they want to take Warner Brothers money this is actually an a24 film this says still a24 is still a big the is still it's corporate Indie it's corporate indie films says dicks the musical is the very first musical from a24 a24 movies always lack the budget but their movies are always full of heart they had won awards and had box office success this company is known for taking risks so it decided to make dicks the musical and they can write it off if it doesn't work yeah so he doesn't have to deal with the consequences when this movie I I predict at least is not going to do very well he has got his own YouTube channel uh this guy's got connections all he was on he he directed and and produced Seinfeld and the and K Your Enthusiasm this guy has all the connections in the world con he has his own like Netflix docu series he could make his own movie fund it yourself bro and then tell me about uh about how uh it's these studios are asking too much of you to want to either make a a strong return on investment I was also just reading this article the other day that I've I've mentioned here before about the kid who the guy the young man who voiced Simba and The Lion King who turned down the $2 million and $2 million in in the early 90s would be a lot more now right like turn down $2 million to get paid royalties on that film uh and instead he got paid $100,000 up front and he wouldn't even tell them how much he makes now that's like that's how much he didn't want like he's probably made is he didn't even want to let people know about cuz it was his mom he basically said his mom stopped him from taking the 2 million she's like no you got to you got to do this at this time they were talking about how Disney re-releases movies all the time like the video the VHS sales are through the roof on all this stuff just hilarious that that they didn't realize this but it's weird to watch Hollywood both at the producer level and at the actor level be like almost guilted by their success and struggle with working in a capitalist system that's benefited them when every level of their ideological beliefs tells them that what they're doing is wrong it's weird well also their entire concept of humor is um self-sabotaging because they believe clearly that you can only make jokes that are punching up rather than punching down thanks for watching listen to full episodes of Pop Culture crisis on Spotify

8,couple of Articles have come out that are talking about a couple of separate very different things so Elon Musk is said to have sent a very Stern letter in which he talked about just burning the house down of Warner of Warner Brothers to make sure that Amber herd kept her role in Aquaman 2o because in 2018 they were after the release of the original Aquaman they were talking about how they were possibly just going to just cut bait and get rid of her because she had no chemistry with Jason mimoa well in comes space daddy space Daddy has to tell them no you're not firing her she's got to keep her job yeah he's kind of the ultimate Amber herd simp he is um a lot of people are talking about this because Amber herd stands aren't exactly the type you would think of as the the average Elon Musk fan so they're like heartbreaking the worst person you know just made a really great Point yeah I saw that um this says uh ultimately the studio never pulled the trigger Trier on firing Amber herd because her former boyfriend and confirmed baby daddy by the way had one of his litigators send a scorched Earth letter to Warner Brothers threatening to burn the house down if the actress wasn't brought back for a sequel says a source familiar with the behindth scenes battle Warner Brothers caved and moveed forward with herd Elon Musk has not responded for a request for comment on this issue I she'd have something fun definitely sounds believable I feel like he'd have a funny response that he's like you better put my baby mama in Aquaman too or I'm going to destroy your company but you said he's actually threatening more so to buy the company like I mean I don't know what the threat would be otherwise buy Warner Brothers and force the issue he's like he's like look I will make sure that nothing but negative articles about Warner Brothers get get pushed on X yes I guess at that no because he didn't own Twitter at the time so what what would he have done like he didn't own Twitter at the time so he's like look I will make sure that nobody in you know when you're that rich you have strings that you can pull like you always have a contact somewhere where you can you can exercise your influence he's like he's like look uh he's like look Mr zaz it wasn't David zaz at this time but whoever it was before zaz he's like look you got a Tesla right sure would be a shame if something happened to the break line in your Tesla if Amber herd didn't get to keep herob mhm um we're also rehashing the notes that were revealed from Amber herd's therapy sessions this says Depp fans paid the court fees for the release of documents from herds therapist Dr Don Hughes the raw notes scribbled on legal pad were part of last year's trial in which Depp largely prevailed they describe a hostile Aquaman set where an allegedly intoxicated Jason mimoa dressed like Depp and pushed to have her booted from her role as mea this says in the notes Jason said he wanted me fired Jason drunk laid on set dressing like Johnny has all the Rings too I like him I like him already there's a $20 one here from Patriot Americans says if you're saying you got Kane Kane hotter I don't know I know who you're talking about he's the guy who plays Jason Vorhees uh for Friday the 13th episode I'm going to lose it no but that would be that would be awesome to have him to have him on um that would be cool a DC spokesperson responded to these rumors said Jason mimoa conducted himself in a professional manner at all times on set of Aquaman in the lost kingdom and another said Jason works his ass off likes to have a beer once in a while like everyone look I you but he doesn't show up drunk I love the idea they're like look so he had a couple of cocktails give the guy a break will you they also added that they were seen joking together and getting along and uh he isn't dressing like Johnny Depp he's just dressing in that Bohemian style hold on I've got the yes thank you the photo is amazing here's the photo yeah like I would mistake him as Johnny Depp from a football field distance if Johnny Depp was was just ripped or maybe Jared Leto I mean I'm talking foot football field distance like I might be like if I squint he's not wearing any rings in this like if if you squint and then you tilt your head like it's it's kind of reminiscent of Johnny Depp's style but um yeah they're like he's he wasn't dressing up as Jack Sparrow he's just Bohemian it's really funny if that's what he was actually doing if he's actually going around and like every day he shows up as a new Johnny Depp character like so he's Edward Scissor Hands one day requires a lot of dedication like he's he just hires the best costume like he just him and like I know what it is is like one day amber herd pissed off the costume designer on the set who goes in and starts working with uh with Jason Mamoa bying jasona dress as very like he's like one day shows up with Sweeny Tod one day shows up with that guy from uh um what was it what was the other one that rear window is he in rear window I don't remember but it'd be great I would love to see him uh in a bunch of different Johnny deppes costumes Jack Sparrow it would be fantastic I'm imagining the GC between Jason mimoa Henry caval and Johnny Depp where they're all egging him on I would love Secret Window thank you not rear window rear window can we subpena the GC uh the boys GC that where they're talking if so who would be on so it would be it would be him it would be Henry caval obviously it would be I think Ben Affleck would be in there because they're all part of the uh because all three of them are part of the original Justice League the one you know Zack Snider's Justice League and then who who was the and then um they're making fun of Ezra Miller and Amber herd mhm yeah they're they're just dunking on that also allegedly Jason mimoa has blocked Amber Herd on Instagram which is supremely petty yeah I don't know if that's true but they don't follow each other on Instagram which again is it's kind of ridiculous that among grown adults that's a sign that you're not friends anymore I mean it it is true though right that like it's like when you when you're in the public eye you have to be aware of like like the fact that they don't follow each other and this movie isn't out yet is insane she does follow Yaya Abdul matin she doesn't follow from the movie but not Jason mimoa so maybe he did block her um all I find it I'm more surprised that you can subpoena therapist notes yeah um in a trial like that when it's not a criminal case because that seems to break dror patient confidentiality laws but uh and it says that also Amber her's lawyers fought against that decision but Depp's lawyers won that argument and they got to see her therapist documents where you know she's she's saying you know also James ju didn't want me on the film it say this is the fun part was treated like a pariah because of her high-profile legal battle quote he raised his voice at me I can't even post about Aquaman he said made it like it was my fault I said I'm sorry nobody could take selfies with me on set given blackout look what's funny is like this is kind of the fundamental difference I think between men and women sometimes in collaborative spaces like this like do you think he was joking no no I'm saying I think the guys will butt heads on set like and and they and the scene will be better for it but like if if it's a woman like Amber herd you can't butt heads with her onet because that's going to be taken as some type of misogyny to for James Juan to be like look you're not really showing any emotions and you smell like you just crapped in someone's bed could you could you get this fixed please and she'd like he's yelling at me because I you know what I mean like uh and it's it's always crazy when you have to think about like I I remember when you did keno corner here me and him were talking about like just how hard a director's job is to have to be so many different you have you have to meet so many people at so many different wavelengths and then push past it to be able to connect with them as a as a director and all well being kind of a kind of a a hotthead like not a hot you have to be very be very very much a dictator to men that might end up water under the bridge but women are are prob are perhaps less likely to be forgiving in those types of situations look at uh Megan Fox with um Michael Bay who's notorious for that same thing right he's like long work hours also compare him to Hitler yeah she called him she basically called him Hitler for make she's like he made me work 12 to 14 hours a day like and people are like bro you could have left the movie if it was well she might not have been able to at that point because it would have been in breach of contract but the point is you signed on to make x amount of money uh and and it's not like and that's the other like it's not like those movie shoots are years of your life working 12 to 14 hours a day it's six months of your life three months of your life working 12 to 14 hours a day for high pay ra you know High pay uh incentives and then depending on how good your agent is stuff you know backend deals for royalties and and other such things so it is weird because we we talk all we we've actually talked several times about the differences when you see like when the women directors talk now or they're like we make like Olivia wild like we made it a collaborative space where everybody wants to feel heard it's like that's not really a director's job no at all it's to make your own point of view heard and ignoring everybody else's actually well yeah that's right like so so it's that's kind of what Greta Gerwig was making it seem like on the set of Barbie as well like we're all just girlfriends and having fun like and that's all well and good until things go wrong that's fine but it's a hundred million doll project at and like poor like poor Warner Brothers is over here with like losing all this money and they're like could you please not be girlfriends and just make a movie that's actually going to make us money cuz all these like all these DC movies are failing could you please like get it together the success of Barbie is kind of making it possible for them to continue making shitty unpopular DC movies it's subsidizing the shitty unpopular d movies um also the DC spokesperson denied that claim that James Juan was trying to get Amber herd fired saying James is known for treating members of his cast and crew with the utmost respect and for fostering a positive collaborative environment on set the Aquaman films were no exception so we'll have to wait and see whether that's true or not I wonder just how much she's not in the film we were significant scenes cut already she got a total of like 02 seconds in the trailer I'm not expecting much from her but I I am expecting there to be like viral Tik toks of people booing when Amber herd shows up on screen I know that's going to happen you were kind of like fascinated by the concept of like chemistry tests right like I didn't well I I'm surprised that Walter Hamada went on the stand and said that she had a lack of chemistry with Jason Mamoa because she did pass a chemistry test at the beginning when they were casting Mara so what changed was probably Jason mima's feelings about Amber herd and him being buddies with Johnny Depp kind of muddies the water but also like when you like it's one thing to do these tests for a little bit of time and see if it works it's another thing to be working long extensive hours uh and then still have to like you've got friends you like right doesn't mean you want to spend 18 hours a day amber herd unleashes her Insanity on whoever she's dating and keeps it professional when she's on set that's that's what I I totally don't buy that I totally compartmentalize no way I don't I don't buy that at all I believe that it bleeds into the work and she like Jason the pictures of Jason mimoa and Amber herd together definitely communicate a lack of chemistry if not outward hatred for each other like they can barely stand next to each other without grimacing yeah like it's it's pretty obvious there were some issues there between the two of them see I I I think it's different I think she gets back from some fight with Johnny and then he says something she's not supposed to like in the movie and she just like and her reaction's like not the reaction of the character her reaction is the reaction of her she's mad at yeah at uh at Depp they uh cut one of their love scenes and they cut a scene where she's fighting Black Manta they cut the love scene they're like they're both like nope not doing what is left after that I don't know the uh the scenes with the baby she's just kind of walking around in the background while he holds holds the baby I it's just it's I I I feel she have like a total of 12 words spoken in the movie and I feel for like I feel so bad in some respects for all of these people on these movies that are like trying their best but DC just can't DC and and Warner Brothers can't seem to freaking crack the code lately they're obligated to release this there were people during the heat of the trial calling for this movie to be scrapped all together calling for her to be fired all together when does this come out comes out in December right in Chris on like I think on Christmas day oh and we got our ticket we got our tickets for the Marvels which we were very excited about the hour and 45 minute run time I was like wow that's a pleasant surprise for a Marvel movie don't have to suffer that long for that one no 2hour long uh two and a half hour Marvel movie it won't be a pleasant hour and 45 minutes but you know at least it's not two hours it'll be le it's not two and a half hours an hour and 45 minutes of CGI vomit is somehow more manageable than two and half hour of CGI vomit so you know uh good for good for Elon Musk though you might be a s but you're a s with uh chivalrous principles the Amber herd stands were tweeting Elon musk's first W uh this guy defending Amber now I've seen everything uh another one said trash supporting trash no surprise uh another one said how f is it that on was it on that set for Elon Musk to be the only person in the right regardless of his reasons his reasons being that he was hypnotized I still think that by thei what it is is he's like look they like I have to li like like he he needs the official like he's got a thing for the authentic costume he's like he needs her to bring home the Mera costume H I'm surprised there isn't like unlicensed merch of uh amber herd as Mercy that just says you should have picked Mercy probably or I mean or like Mara like or her Aqua her outfit from Aquaman like that's what it is he's like he doesn't care about Amber herd he cares about Amber herd in the costume and he needs the official one that she wore on the movie for authenticity another one said f him Amber herd deserved to be fired she's an abuser and piece of [ __ ] Johnny Depp lost M money and movie roles because of the lies she told the fact that people are still defending this [ __ ] is hilarious to me #d double standards well we we'll have to see where it goes even a broken clock is right twice a day she uh she hasn't posted much on Instagram lately she posted once uh this was back like she's promoting her in the fire movie this was like four this was like several months ago was her showing up at an event and it says what a reception thank you to all my fans and supporters I don't know if all those people were there for her specifically but I could be wrong I could be wrong about that like may maybe that's or maybe this is one of those things where she just like she's like every time she makes a guy that she's dating upset she offers to like cosplay as some like roleplay as some character and then like Johnny Depp just didn't have any cu he's just old like I'm sorry that I took your phone and blocked your mother's number yeah now all cosplay is Mercy can you can that make it up to you what what would Johnny Depp want her to cosplay as though like like the lady from Sound of Music thanks for watching listen to full episodes of Pop Culture crisis on Spotify keep up with us

"
12,"hello YouTube family Auntie is here I'm Patty Jackson I am your auntie of Pop Culture it's Monday are you ready to start the week cuz there's a lot to discuss it's not cute not knowing and now you're going to know but we're starting off with a hug cuz I know somebody out there needs a hug the number one movie of the box office was Exorcist believe this is the one with lesie odm JR it was 50 years ago that the original Exorcist hit the scene and this one they were able to bring back Ellen bursten and Linda Blair who played the kid possessed in this movie they brought them back for Cameo rules but it was number one at the box office I don't like scary movies but over the weekend I finally sat and watched get out the Jordan pill movie with Daniel Kula Le Stanfield what a brilliant movie God I would love to just sit down and talk to Jordan PE what a brilliant movie scary there were some scenes like I just don't like horror movies but that was a brilliant movie for those who are saying you're just getting around and seeing this movie cuz I don't like horror movies I don't I don't like them and I'm hesitant and I rely on you guys to tell me what's going on but it was excellent get out had to be one of the best movies I've ever seen the plot twists and turns and Brilliant Jordan Peele what a masterpiece we're going to start off with Jada pinket Smith and before you start with the comments we don't want to hear about Jada you're going to hear about all week long because this book is coming out on October 17th we got to do the leader to the book on Friday she sits down with her cop there's a big NBC special on Friday night she's going to be all on The Today Show and you're going to see the media blitz of this book worthy Jaden picket Smith 52 years old married to Will Smith they've been married 26 years two beautiful children stepson she's got that family but in this book she talks about how both of her parents were drug addicts how she dealt with severe depression and PTSD she said she didn't want to be a doting wife that wasn't enough for her to be a doting wife to Will Smith she turned to Voodoo she turned to Voodoo and another spiritual mysticisms look at me sound like Maurice White mysticisms and world religions she turned to that to try to find happiness why couldn't she find happiness you know you look at her life and it's like wow you Smith he's a superstar you guys are rich but that does not necessarily bring you happiness I hope she talks about what made her get into this entanglement and I hope that she talks about CU they always say these two had open marriage don't know but what made her cheat own will she said you know that they had patches where it just wasn't good but these two write it out because I don't see them ever divorcing each other but turning to Voodoo God is the only one who can help you through I know aun te that and preach God is the only one I don't believe in all that that that who doing on I'll believeing all that if you got a problem you take it to God because he's the only one who can give you answers and Lead You and trust me if you ask to be led he'll lead you you just may not want to go where he wants you to go but she goes into detail and worthy I guess because for years she did not feel worthy of anything could it it come from her childhood drug you know addicted parents coming up in Baltimore you know starting with one of the cast members on a different world but then coming up and finding success meeting Will Smith I'm sure there'll be a whole series on on Tupac but I just thought her and Tupac were just friends and not anything more this book is going to be very interesting cuz I really hope that she talks about what led you in to this entanglement with August Al CA men and women cheat for different reasons and I think it's more hurtful for a woman cuz it usually something emotional they're seeking something this book is going to be interesting Friday night on NBC and then went hold a copy now for everybody because y'all tore me up last week I don't know if the book is going to do well judging by the reactions of you guys and people like we don't care we're going to see how this book does I didn't see the golden Bachelor but I watched it over the weekend um listen I forgot to write her name down she said Auntie it's a little it was a little boring and it was it was it was a little boring but the woman of Indian descent she is no longer on the show because she had a family crisis so she had to leave the show so that's why she's not on um I like that little bitty Natasha I liked her energy she didn't get a rose and the one woman this is when I'm morphing to my mother all they kissing and she still Ain get a rose I could hear that in my in my head my mother's voice see the kissing don't be doing that kissing cuz you because you may not even get a rose and you're just all this kissing and Mr Jerry's always Mr Gary's always crying he is always crying cuz he I don't want to hurt anybody I don't want to break anybody's heart well Mr Gary with the kissing you are cuz you kind of leading the morning and they thinking that they gonna be the one Mr Gary's father and Mr Gary is 72 his dad's got to be near 90 well child got him talking to the press and he said I hope these women are ready to move cuz he ain't moving from Indiana I said now where they find his dad his dad said these women if they're chosen they they're going to have to move to be with Mr Gary Mary J blig giving $330,000 creating this scholarship for sophomore women at Hampton University you know a lot of times you get the money going in but what about that middle time what about if you're a sophomore or a junior and the money runs out and you don't have the money it's a great thing that Mary jve V is doing Janet Jackson is being sued her former business people are saying she stiff them they're suing her to the tune of $200,000 and they tracked her down in the UK Rea McIntyre they're saying that she is not happy on The Voice she's a country music legend and she was kind of put into replace Blake Shelton you got Gwen Stefani NY horin you got John Legend The Voice great talent goes on that show but no one ever becomes a superstar and that's my problem the voice is more about the judges than the actual talent reben McIntyre is seeing how cruel and vicious they are to get singers you got to be fast when you hit that button there was this one young lady on there doing mini repetend she turned all those cheers around because she hit that those unique vocals that Minnie rton had she feels is a lot a backbiting and undercutting and I'm thinking can't can't be from John Legend she's seeing how difficult it is and she says she didn't sign up for this maybe she didn't watch the show maybe she just thought oh it's a good idea I'll be on the voice but they're vicious they are vicious and they will do anything to get the best contestants the bot Marley movie One Love supposed to come out in January U AR Kingsley benadir lesaa Lynch are playing Bob and Rita Marley I Love Bob Marley I can't wait to see this movie it looks so good not coming out in January they've moved it to Valentine's Day but that's one of the big movie releases for 2024 Mission Impossible dead reckoning it's going to be arriving on digital platform starting tomorrow when you go through things in life and depression is real you know no one ever likes to say that they've reached a period in their life where they can go through depression and anything could Le the loss of a job a loved one situation and life you will go through every day it's not going to be great but when you go through what I call when you have to go down into the V Valley you learn so much having an attitude of gratefulness is so important because when you're grateful for what you have you're not going to be looking over there and being envious and jealous and wishing that you had that everybody is unique in their own way I just don't believe in all that Voodoo and all and all that stuff I don't cuz there's all only one person and that's God that you may not want to be led where he's leading you to like I want to do that I don't want to do that but he answers your prayers and can give you the peace that you're seeking or helping you to say that you really have it going on but maybe you should bless others to feel that voice void that part where they said the Jade and the voodoo I'm I'm just end on that I'm this book is going to be interesting how truthful will she be it's called worthy she has a story to tell and she's going to tell her story and this is Jada pinket Smith's story cannot wait to see what else is revealed in this book but depression and PTSD these things are real and a lot of times people like are afraid to say this is me this is my life it is okay to say I'm not okay but it's also okay to trust in God because in my humble opinion he's the only one who could lead you through troubled times somebody gonna be like damn you was preaching today it's curls and scoop is wisdom it's just it's like it's it's like a soap it's like Gumball some days it's going to be spicy some days it's going to be food for thought but I appreciate you guys and I thank you leave your comments I can let you know right now that we'll probably be talking about this damn book all week so leave a comment give us a thumbs up if you like the video and most importantly subscribe to the channel and never you'll never miss a beat tomorrow I really want to get into the

1986 was it there was a lot of brutality and in some scenes very hard to watch I don't think we're going to see that in this new version of of the movie musical cuz they're saying it's not your mama's Color Purple I think his character will be mean you know to show the contrast that he wasn't nice to missile but it's going to be different and it's not going to be as brutal back in the 80s I

curls in the scoop and let's do this [Music] hug there's going to be a movie we're going to start with movie talk there's going to be a movie based on the life of Mariah Carey it's going to be a TV movie directed by Lee Daniels do you think it would have to be a newcomer playing Mariah Carey I think they'd have to find a newcomer now my question is does this young lady does she have to sing will Mariah do the vocals cuz Mariah Cary has a very unique voice but look for that movie in the works also a movie based on the life of Dr Martin Luther King Jr yes another one but this one is going to be a little different different directed by Chris Rock it's one of the projects that he's going to be doing ever since Trevor Noah left The Daily Show the big question was well who's going to replace him one of the men that wanted to replace him because you don't know if it's going to be a man or a woman was Roy Woods Jr an Acclaim comedian who had been with The Daily Show for eight years he had filled in a few times but something must have happened where it was like you're not getting a job he wanted the job and campaigned for it he recently did the White House Press association dinner they must have told him you're not getting the job so Roy Woods Jr after eight years of being you know doing skits and doing stuff for the Daily Show he has decided he is leaving the show who are they going to get will it be an Indian actor comedian will it be a woman it won't be Roy Woods Jr because he has left the show Jason Derulo the popular Tick Tock dancer influencer I'll never forget my niece loves him she's eight and she heard me say that all right Jason dero is not my cup of tea you know you gotta be careful what you say around kids so I said I said I don't like no Jason dulo and she said you don't like him why why don't you like him and I you always got to be careful but he's not my cup of tea but so many people love him and his dancing is incredible well Jason Derulo is in trouble he's being sued for sexual harassment by a young woman she was signed to his record label and she says when she refused to have sex with him he dropped her from the label RuPaul one of my faves is writing a memoir I would love to know how he started you know he does the drag but when I met him and interviewed him he didn't have on all that no makeup or anything he's incredibly tall but I would love to know how he got started and and made a name and VH1 they've got RuPaul's Drag Race I met RuPaul in Florida and his publist was like he's not talking to anybody so here I go I was all

Barrymore her talk show I don't know how long it's going to last and I'm going to tell you why doing the rider strike she decided I'm coming back to work we're going to do the show anyway well then

sensitive they said they're not coming back so she's going to to get new writers I don't know when her show is going to return but that is not a good sign Saturday Night Live is returning next weekend and they're going to have Pete Davidson hopefully he doesn't crash any cards between now and then but he's going to be the musical host I got to make sure that I say this right because I be calling it the wrong name ice spice I call an ice box ice spice who's performing in Philadelphia at our sister station Powerhouse look at me with the plug the 40th anniversary of Powerhouse [Music] um she's performing and Pete Davidson is going to be the musical guest I knew if I got the name wrong that Toya would be like you're saying you're saying her name wrong the golden Bachelor I got scooped it's

laugh but Mr Gary He's a little ladies man Tamar bra and this her week I know y'all tired of hearing about it but now she's saying that the man the white man from the Queen's Court reality show supposedly has a lot of money he's an attorney with a ton of kids she says that she got dumped by him right at the same time her vehicle got robbed and vandalized now I said maybe he's tired of the drama some people are like I just want peace I don't want a lot of drama maybe she thought she can get a couple of dollars cuz sometime you know if something happens to you you know people step up oh I got you I'mma help you out maybe he decideed he didn't want to do that and help her out but actress Little Mermaid star little Ariel hie biley that girl is pregnant and they're like drop the ACT drop the coats big clothes just say you're pregnant she's pregnant by the rapper ddg and we'll have to ask Toya who he is cuz is but Disney is a little ticked off at her I think for I guess being single she's 23 and pregnant now many of you might say well who cares you know because it's it's so normalized now but she's hiding this pregnancy for a reason but at some point hie Bailey is going to be like surprise I'm pregnant there's a new comedy thrill I believe it's coming to MTV will Packer is producing it binge to death it's a comedy horror film with Lonnie Love and the guy that played cockroach Joel Martin Carl Anthony Payne they play two best friends who kidnapped two of their favorite reality stars because they broke up it's coming out of the 17th does sound interesting to you uh talking about Chris Rock directing a movie on Martin Luther King Jr and the NFL the big story this week NFL Travis Kelsey and Taylor Swift and if you said to yourself why is there such interest they want Taylor to do a Super Bowl one year it won't be next year cuz we got user but she's never done it she's never appeared she's never did a cameo they're looking and they want for a future superable halftime show they want tayor so they're showing her a whole lot of love to see if she'll consider I think one day she will when she's not touring and you know she has some time she has nothing to prove but there's something about that Prestige of Performing halftime at the Super Bowl there's also a tremendous amount of criticism and in this day and age it's hard to please everybody it's hard to please it's hard to please everyone but I think one day she will do it not next year we got Usher and roller skates and all that good stuff but I do think that one year tayy Swift will do the halftime show we lost one of our co-workers here our work you know it's so funny when people say where you come from I'm a radio announcer in Philadelphia WD look at me move the hair out iHeart Radio

23,we stayed there when I was like young I was like I just want to stay in like the haunted room and uh so we did stay in in the haunted room a friend of mine was the first one to tell me about it because we always have this joke that when anything breaks in our house it always breaks on a Friday night or a Saturday morning and a couple months ago our water heater broke on a Friday night so we had no hot water and we couldn't get our normal plumber to come out until Monday which is fair but you know a weekend with two kids with no hot water is is very rough and my friend about thumb Tac and you could just find someone that's willing to work in your area that has the reviews and I was like this is genius I used to joke it's like the metaphor the horror of Home owning is you know sort of what we're representing here but it also what I love about Thumbtack it allows you it because I'm a planner I'm very OCD like that and so you know it can remind you okay time to get the gutters clean time to do these things which you know in everyday life we forget until our are totally clogged up and everything you know to keep an Integrity of a house you have to do that constant con maintenance or it will literally implode on you you know especially the first time you're ever like really in a house by yourself I grew up in an apartment in New York City and houses make noises and you know and and Floors Creek and and it is it can be really unsettling I am very big on energy so when I'm like looking at a house like I feel the energy when I come in obviously uh no previous uh homicidal deaths is like a really big number one for me but our house now was only owned by one or the family who we know and they're still happy and so this house has like that energy what I was I was saying earlier you know the Hotel Del Coronado we stayed there when I was like young I was like I just want to stay in like the haunted room and uh so we did stay in in the haunted room but the weirdest part was I slept to the night great which I never do like physical labor is him but speaking of ghosts I'm definitely Tech it I will sort of test out everything um so it's it's pretty shared thankfully my husband and I are known for every year for our coup's costumes and all that but this year we're stepping it up which is because my kids have birthdays 12 hours apart it's just always like really crazy so this year they're finally W we're going to do not scary farm with and it's like 50th Anniversary so it's going to be like Spooktacular we all like them and my daughter just got into it she used to be like really freaked out by that stuff something happened and my daughter suddenly loves anything horror scary because she loves Halloween she loves the idea of a dress up costume but now she's into like the fun day to day you know it's it's a learning curve and you know all of the ages are wonderful and they're scary and traumatic and you know I'm just lucky that I have two healthy wonderful kids and that we're going to navigate all this together and somehow manage to work and have fun and do all the things any relationship whether it's a romantic relationship whether it's a partnership or whether it's a friendship is you have to put work into it and if you're not willing to do the work then it's not going to succeed and and that's the truth of anything I'm still trying to figure out if you say break a leg or good luck I still couldn't figure that out I told her to break a leg but only in the metaphorical sense I would rather deal with haunted houses that is less scary to me than dancing on live television we had this year in particular has been a tough year for us like with all the rains and we had a actually we had a tree fall from a neighbor's property next on the list is to finally fix the roof but it was actually my husband and I yesterday were talking about like what next project is but those are the things too that make it special when you you know figure out what the next project is that you want to work on that isn't mandatory we always make sure that we go to Hawaii you know as many times as we're fortunate enough to get to go because that's the place where we always say the Mana of the island just gets us and we can really let go and just enjoy and relax and not have to plan and and really just feel the spirit I have not done a gut Renault yet and you know we've talked about it like is once the kids grow up do we then build something because the thing hard thing is like as your life evolves your needs change too with home and I I was I was I was telling everyone at sunch too like I wish this had been around when I was 20 and a homeowner because it just would have helped me so much to be able because how do you cut through everything right to find out because now you have this like leaking faucet right and you come home in your sink and the water is spilling everywhere and the dogs are licking it up and you're just trying to like you know how do you figure out who's a person in your area that has good reviews that's you know and you try to call friends but you know their person's not available I don't know if you've ever done the app but like it starts by asking you like what are the things your house needs what are the things that you haven't Tak care of what's the the weather too especially like for us in California we've had such massive amounts of rain our houses are just not built to withstand that because it's not something that people take into consideration although I keep joking that I don't know why they want me to do the hotline because if it come if that house is haunted my answer is [Music] move,ioy78RxEzMI," Oprah talks about her experience staying in a haunted room at the Hotel Del Coronado, her kids'
