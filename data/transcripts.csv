go like I have to do some back of the napkin calculations but we could figure it out like it's you know that's not that's not because it's a lot it's cuz I'm just I'm old and I'm not making that promise it's hidden figures thank you yes exactly that's exactly right uh guys today we got a bunch of stuff to discuss Dylan malaney has won an award Woman of the Year good for him it exactly isn't there already a more stablished Woman of the Year award this one is the attitude magazine Woman of the Year award I'm I'm sure there's others right but there are too many yeah so is there a man of the year award well you men men don't get as much rotat don't get man of the in the back no men don't get men of the year they just get like Nobel prizes and they actually make scientific discoveries and stuff like that I can already see somebody in the chat going based there's a $20 Super Chat here from Francisco Sanchez Jr he says Let's Hear It for the Boy uh the girl anyways congrats Dylan oh oh okay Sounds sounds like Dylan mulany just got um a gender reveal party that would be that would well we're going to be talking about those cuz there's like one of those gets mentioned in the in the segment about the influen andina no yes CH making fun of me okay so so today guys we're going to be talking about Dylan mulany we're also going to be talking about Bobby alof or as one of the comments said Bobby altright because they're calling her they're calling her racist because she did this interview with Scarlett Johansson and she like wasn't in character and they're saying that she only does the character when she's talking to people of color which you know that's a that's a pretty like bold claim is Mark Cuban a person of color I I have no idea if he counts is he Cuban I don't know what his name just Cuban I I don't know if Cuban people have the name Cuban that doesn't really seem like it makes much sense okay just checking She interviewed Mark Cuban which was like more surprising than Drake yeah where does Mark Cuban find the time to do like a joke podcast I have no idea right like that guy's busy he's got stuff to do so we're gonna talk about that we're also going to talk about20 oh right here from eres o says don't worry Phil you'll eventually get the same musical level as Brett keep your chin up little buddy I I'm I'm always positive always positive so it's uh what is my music I don't have a musical level I'm not musical I think that's the point that's the that's so you're you're you're like you're going to become zero don't worry Phil one day you'll be as tall as Brett that is unlikely that's uh it could still happen I I didn't drink enough milk as a kid that's the problem I I Rec I was that I went to the doctor to get my uh knee checked out when when last week and uh they measured me and I'm exactly 56 so if you're 5'6 then we're good yeah yeah I'm 5'5 so I think you're I think you're taller than me actually so there you go he's taller than me ladies and gentlemen uh and the party told you to forget every yeah it's good we're going to we're going to talk about that uh so sag Afra has got into more of a an argument with the all of the studios in which they're telling them they're calling what the studi is doing bully tactics because they haven't been able to settle on a new deal the writers have a deal the the actors do not I got that and I got a couple of other articles that are really really breaking down all of the chaos that's going on in Hollywood right now on the writers actors uh and director side of things so we're going to get into all of that stuff we're going to keep the conversation more General but the general request that they're making here about Revenue sharing is kind of insane to me we'll get into it more uh also there's an influencer who is what's her name again the the influencer's name oh it's uh Linda and Dr she she's getting she's gone viral for going on like a two and a half million dollar shopping spree and people are kind her husband's credit card I'm sure her husband's rich Lally called gold it's like gold digger inspo content yes and and you were saying that you think that this would have been more at home back in 2016 yeah yeah like Flex culture is not really as common anymore now that everyone is resentful of bomic that we're suffering right now there's a okay there there's probably a great skid idea somewhere about like biomics Flex culture that somebody could be making right now that'd be great so we got that we got a bunch of other stuff so if you guys are ready we will get right into it Mary are you ready I'm ready let's go didn't even have to ask him ladies and gentlemen he's ready to go I mean there's no one else here so all right so first things first uh this is not the greatest news in the world if you're a Marvel fan the Marvel's box office estimates a $39 million uh tickets are in the gutter I love that it is the picture of uh she looks so sad I mean doesn't she always wistful even yeah she she doesn't look happy to me does she no no she does not so it says uh following ticket sales going on sale Tuesday it's claimed that the mark Mar's ticket pre-sales are in the gutter as less than a third of the James gun of James guns Guardians of the Galaxy which could mean the flick would open to less than 39 million that's very low that's DC level low right what did Blue Beetle get uh 25 I think in its opening weekend yeah I think so okay I can't even believe that that was actually a movie it was a movie it was a movie uh and and we're we're talking about this because right now there's also this article that's been going around where they're talking about how they're going to be like reworking the Marvel television formula meaning less they're they're not going to be doing the event series anymore six episodes they're actually going to try to do more actual serialized TV that will actually have showrunners shocking that they didn't have show Runners I didn't know that they had no showrunners my guess would be uh well they they had showrunners they had people that were attached as like main producers but it's because at the end of the day Kevin feige is the showrunner for everything the final word always one man can't pay attention to all of those projects at once meaning some of them end up being trash I I would say most of them yeah maybe I mean or like he just puts more focus on the movies I saw people reacting to this news saying that Marvel is taking credit for the changes that the writer strike actually won this one tweet says we didn't strike for nearly five months for companies to take credit for this these companies aren't doing this simply because they realized the process wasn't working but because writers struck to require that showrunners be writers and not non-writing Executives or directors and we won that's crazy too because the I don't believe that you actually need the showrunner to be a writer the community note also clarified the same thing that these results aren't because Marvel chose them it's because the strike chose it for them yeah uh I I really don't think that the the showrunner needs to be a writer on the series I think that they have to that their job is supposed to be the 30,000 foot view now they can write like on network television a showrunner will write some episodes Jonathan Nolan wrote some episodes of Person of Interest but it would be intermittently throughout the show's 5year run or a lot of times like they'll take a like they'll take on like the big episodes right like JJ Abrams would some would sometimes write the big episodes in the middle of the Season like the the mid-season finale or something like that but yeah I don't know if that's I don't know if that's really necessary and the strike is going to end up affecting a lot more people and people just don't realize it yet one of the things that I thought was interesting somebody pointed out that the the studios seem to be interested in like the quiet victories meaning they get to fire or not renew the deals that they want to get and that the actors are are interested in the or the the unions are interested in the loud victories meaning the article headlines that say that they got their way and are getting what they want but $39 million just remember guys the the first movie with Captain Marvel and it made a billion dollars supposedly supposedly alleged alleged an alleged billion dollars so6 billion doll billion yeah like when when uh when Trump mentioned billion dollar to Iran it was like the most Trump six billion I've ever heard 6 billion doll he like went above and above and beyond in his Annunciation good uh Trump imp person it's a hard one to do uh so yeah and and all of this pales in comparison to Taylor Swift who's saying who's supposedly supposed to open to $150 million this weekend for the ays tour movie yeah I didn't know if that was supposed to include pre-sales or not's already over 100 million in pre-sale tickets but that's worldwide not get 25 million more yeah the day of yeah so she stays winning $150 million just in the opening weekend for her so take that see the AOS tour film uh as a Swifty probably not I suspect that this is going to be another event movie just like Barbie was think so girl groups are going to go together they're going to dress up for it they're going to have friendship bracelets it's going to be a whole event you know what they should be doing right now is Starbucks should be like cutting a deal with these theaters to like sell in the theaters beforehand sell pumpkin spice lattes the theat for the swifties yeah and I think the swifties are going to go multiple times think oh you think so oh yeah yeah yeah I think you're right about that I think it's perfectly reasonable to think that when like when they go like one girl will go with like one of her groups of friends and then her other friends will want to go and she'll have to go with them as well they'll go with their moms yeah I I buy that I buy that might drag their boyfriends oh that's you know you know all right also did anybody see the Pander ver the the advertis oh God I can't wait it's it's so good like if you see this picture ladies and gentlemen let me put it on the screen there I I expected Cartman's character she should have been a little fatter because they they Tinder out yeah they she should have been as fat as Cartman they should have know what they should have done they should have just turned Cartman into lizo they couldn't fit that on screen they if they just turned Cartman into lizo it would have been perfect yes you're totally right that they would have just had lizo play and then they have lizo voice Cartman in the episode yeah well I doubt she would have done it but or they could have done a thing where like like somehow they split the voices it's like half lizo half Cartman h i mean I maybe' be good I think it'd be is token gonna be white now I mean he kind of has to be right do you have a bass he' probably be the only white person yeah he'd have to be like the only white guy yep uh oh somebody mentions that I said that theaters make their money on upcharging on popcorn and soda yeah but I'm saying like if they if they tried to cut a deal with Starbucks for like a huge flat fee that would be really really good I saw they're already doing pumpkin spice popcorn oh sounds gross that's awful and that's coming from somebody popcorn is bad in my opinion I don't mind it I've been eating they have like this smart food Doritos flavored popcorn it's probably awesome it's it's awesome like it's it's weird too because it's like I'm seeing this like more common now where they're mixing like chip flavors with other chip flavors it's like they've run out of ideas and they've got like Brands now so like nacho cheesee is a brand for Doritos Cool Ranch is a brand pickle flavor chips are good they're they're pretty vinegary do you have a favorite chip flavor I think it I like kettle chips okay so like Cape Cod regular with uh hell of a good dip is probably so not salt and vinegar or anything like that I mean I love salt and vinegar I I I wouldn't turn those down oh that reminds me also while I've been watching the new season of Love is Blind I noticed that they're intentionally putting food on on screen in every place just because of the lawsuits saying that they're starving contestants I like the idea that it's fake food cuz that's a that's a real thing don't you dare open that it's just it's like an apple and the guy bites it and St really over the top like they're showing them cooking they're putting just mountains of snacks in the rooms just to to let everyone know that they're they're not starving them how's that season going it's horrible it's supposed to be it's what do you think is like a bigger sign of Western decline like modern entertainment like at the studio level like like movies and television or reality TV I like reality TV better at this point you'd rather watch reality TV yeah uh I don't think that people go on Love is Blind to find love I think they're going on love is blind or any of these shows to get Instagram followers so that they can have a an influencer brand after the fact get brand deals makes perfect sense like there there's a better pipeline for people who are doing that now than there ever was was when reality shows first came around like you were kind of still at the whims of like whoever would hire you after the fact now you develop that huge social media following and you can go do whatever you want it's kind of a you know good for them they don't need a un you can do whatever you want even sue the reality show that made you famous exactly they can do that that's fine so we'll have to see what the panda reverse looks like when it comes out going be wonderful did you see Ryan Long's new skit No oh okay you have to like when when when today's done you have to go check out he has a new one it's like uh being an actor and figuring out whether you support Israel or Palestine oh God it's it's so good it's it's so good I can't even believe I mean I I'll I'll go check it out yeah yeah you got to see it all right uh Mary found this one this is creepy it's just creepy Jaya Smith's video interview has come out today and uh she looks like an evil super villain she does or Crime Boss like she looks like an evil mob boss yeah like she could be Amanda Waller she was she's too skinny play to play Mand but she was uh she was um Fish Mooney on uh on Gotham so she's got it you were more terrified by the interviewer uh I just thought the interviewer like the lipstick was unfortunate like the lipstick was there are so many surprising things in the book but the thing that surprised me the most that I actually had to reread it because I said is this true right who was the lady from um who was the lady from Terminator the lady pler that pler oh I which which one the original one that yeah that that played um I forget her name yeah the actress's name but she looks like a mixture of her and and Kamala Harris Jada does in 2016 you and will decided you were going she looks like Linda Hamilton andala Harris together it was not a divorce on paper but it was a divorce so from the the year 2016 which is 7 years ago now yes y'all have been apart yeah there are so many she just does look kind of vaguely evil yeah like not not like super evil but just vaguely evil am I crazy for saying this I feel like Jada Smith is faking the alipa she or maybe she's exaggerating it why would she fake that attention attention which is what she wants attention is it really that like does she get a lot of I guess does she go to like like alipa events and stuff like that like blowing up her own marriage she still wants people to see her as the victim yeah I mean but that's then she's failed at it because nobody looks at her as a victim everybody looks at her as as just vaguely e but I'm I'm just saying her her hair looks full to me I I don't see any any bald patches maybe it's just a really short wig really yeah she and then it's like oh she's so brave for not wearing wigs you know what it is it's it's not the it's not even just it's the um it's the slow nod that's what makes it vague no I think it was the yes surprising things slow nod that surprised me the most that I actually had to reread it maybe Trump caused their divorce maybe that's what it was Trump got elected and they're like we can't handle this anymore because I said is this true right was that in 2016 you and will decided that you were going to live completely separate lives it's a very it's a very evil head play it it was not a divorce on paper but it was a divorce okay why why would he why would he stay with her like for the kids or something cuz that for appearances because the kids knew the whole time that they were separated but that hasn't looked well like it doesn't look good the kids are still a train WX and the the whole the whole thing with like um with the with the fighting and and doing all the Red Room stuff and all that stuff you're you're separated you are got you are for all intense and purposes divorced and you still go through all that humiliating [ __ ] like I feel terrible for for Will Smith but Will Smith needs to man up and walk the F away from that woman like the way she worded it is that she can't bring herself to fully divorce will yeah that is that is manipulative disgusting Behavior will needs to stand up and be like I can bring myself to do it and walk the F away mhm and he seems like he's just really devoted and he he'll he'll just put up with whatever scraps she provides him unreal and that's just sad for him I guess all right oh so they're saying that the Dylan danis and Logan Paul fight might be cancelled because I I don't think they're going to cancel it it's scheduled for this Saturday and we asked you in the poll today who you think is going to win uh right now Nina Agdal is winning with 39% % I who do you think is going to win Phil Phil uh well it's a boxing match right yeah I think probably Logan Paul cuz Dylan not that Dylan danis is like some like a tough guy or whatever he's he's a a Jiu-Jitsu guy and and you know I said Logan Paul I had no I had no justification for it I just Lan Paul's been actually boxing people so like he's not I don't know that like what level of actual boxing he'd be if it was like real fights as opposed to the the types of fights that he's been doing um but Dylan even though Dylan is a great jiu-jitsu fighter he's he's he's in a totally different element than than his his normal here's the clip he does lay he looks like at this press conference Dylan danis kind of he got look at this like as he's hitting him the other guys grab Logan so he couldn't even defend himself as this was happening yeah like he couldn't even get his hands up because they grabbed him Dylan shouldn't have done on that you know that was uh that was that was crazy uh it's unprovoked I I feel like Logan Logan will end up winning but this is one of those things where it's going to be like it's all going to be kind of a let down afterward well Logan believes that he's going to win no matter what because he wants to sue Dylan into Oblivion regardless of the the results of the boxing match and he's I think that's a the dirty way what's he going for picking on my girlfriend yeah his lawsuit with Nina ogal has a she has a temporary against him right now he can't post any pictures of her they're claiming that he illegally accessed her social media accounts Dylan D Dylan danis is like a hacker he's got the sunglasses on it's like the it's like the Matrix in the main Snapchat obtained private videos and just to publish them but they claim that he started this years ago which is insane like defamation he wants to impoverish Dylan danis regardless of the results of the fight which honestly makes Logan look cowardly like just let the fight speak for itself I mean it could just be a tactic to get into his head before the fight yeah I guess also Dylan danis uh choked out an only fans model she said it was like the greatest thing yeah we talked about El Brook before isn't she an adult actress or it's both it says only fans Model Mary doesn't like that term only I mean she's not modeling you're not modeling [ __ ] you're naked it's activities that she's doing it's not modeling is the is the video here want goep this is scary who is it that um died during one of these like this is happened she like almost blacked out yeah he put her out she looks like she's having a seizure that's what happens when you get knocked out when you're fix I think I think Hulk Hogan choked out a TV presenter once back before like WrestleMania 3 or something like that that happens sometimes that uh they take it very seriously over there when you called it fake back then yeah I don't think that was I don't think that was that was Hogan I think it was someone else that was um Piper might have been Piper I think it Piper who got very who took it very personally if you made comments about wrestling being fake yeah all right oh ALS uh what's going on with this one yeah the remember when Joe interviewed Miley Cyrus that's like three years ago now three that's like five emergencies ago there was a clip of that interview that went viral on Tik Tok and Noah Cyrus commented the disrespect in this video because Joe Rogan was commenting on her maybe growing up and seeing all the crazy [ __ ] that happened to you it's almost like growing up around an alcoholic and never wanting to drink exactly it can go one way or the other right you either become my little sister who kind of wants it you know she's got a record out that I love called the end everything what's her name no Osiris and it's the most depressing EP you'll ever listen to she's 20 years old it's depressing she's she's emo she's like an emo kid uh why is she emo maybe because she was on the road reg she has a song where she say is emo back is emo officially back I have no idea I mean it was in like 2018 when this interview happened where's where's Carter when you need him we need to ask Carter I mean what is emo my sister's like sunshine and it'll follow her wherever she goes but I'm more like a rain cloud you know it's like she's really got this idea of me um maybe she needs to go to the doctor she is we're all at the doctor a lot we we have like a salary doctor that just we got to deal with that yeah she she's dealing with it she's dealing with it but she's only 20 so I I I worry about it's the hardest age for kids today too it's so hard dude if you don't look like these girls on Instagram right now they don't even look like these girls um again more more of the kind of Evangel I in to like going to therapy and stuff I me how is how is this disrespectful though yeah why was it oh that that the argument is it's disrespectful no Osiris said that it's disrespectful like I mean I I took that as a joke I I I took it as a joke helmet I love did you guys see the uh um what's her name Candace Owens when she talked that uh there was a trans person or whatever a non-binary person she she's like how do you uh how do you go around saying blah blah blah and and cause harm and you know typical leftwing Gob she just goes get a helmet man I'm too pregnant for this like that's brilliant not that I you not the too pregnant get a helmet how how do you justify actively victimizing trans people on this campus get a helmet absolutely it is ridiculous the way that we treat people that as soon as they say oh I have been aggressed against everyone just loses their mind as if they actually were and treats them as if they need to be coddled and stuff it's ridiculous where do you think that that inclination comes from in society to like to immediately no I'm saying to immediately acques to like helicop parents you think it's the parents that have caused the people to be like look deal that that makes people to say look deal my generation was latchkey kids right like we were sent home a lot of us had were were like fend for yourself my parents were definitely like go outside what are you doing inside get the hell out of here come back when the street lights are on those kind of things um and now and and since people have fewer kids um in the past you know 20 30 years people have invested more in their kids and that's where you see parents that are like well I'm only having one so we need to make sure that everything's taken care of and they go out of their way to make the to make the world flat for them as opposed to teaching them to be resilient so it's helicopter parents and it's a massive problem in our society because we have a huge amount of people that have not grown up that's why you see I think that's part of the reason why you see kids that are living with their parents and well into their 30s you know know mid mid 20s mid-30s they're they're you know still living at home not only because of the economic issues that you know it's expensive and stuff like that to to move out and [ __ ] but like it used to be you could get roommates and and see that what I think is the most interesting about that argument now is people talk about how uh they're living at home because it's so expensive to move out and live on your own I'm like when I was that age you weren't expected to move out and live on your own you were expected to find roommates because you weren't going to be able to afford the rent on a place on your own that was never actually a thing forget buying a home like they can't even rent because in some areas it's like 2,800 for one bedroom yeah you got to you got to make and and you got to make like nine zillion times your your rent before they'll even approve your application for I understand there's economic factors but I really do think that a lot of it because this is only recent too like the economic factors like it hasn't been like this for the past 20 years in the early early auts kids could move the the economic situation was not like it is now you could find places for somewhat reasonable prices and kids just weren't moving out they weren't going and starting their lives there's like they called it Failure to Launch there's a $20 Super Chat here from John Stewart says hi Brett hi Mary hi Phil happy Friday hi John I do not appreciate the gaslighting here it's not Friday uh that that's interesting too because for a lot of it is like um isn't America kind of unique in that we do kick people out at 18 and that's not necessarily common in I don't think we do that anymore at all but I'm but that it used to be considered pretty Norm like for me it was like if you want to live at home you have to go to college like if you want to live at home for free you got to go to college or you got to pay rent which is even dumber it's like hey if you want to live at home for free you better rack up $100,000 of debt first I mean again it also it also depends because you're talking about like when when my sister went to college she's like 2 years older than me when she went to college she had to work but again this is like you know 90s so she had to work and she could live at home because she worked and went to college and she paid for her debt she didn't take on you you know 100 Grand in debt you don't have to take on 100 Grand in debt as much as people think that oh this is just the way that it is you don't have to take on that debt it is hard you it's going to mean a lot of work but it's better to go and pay for your college or pay for most of your college while you're in college so when you get out of college you can actually take some of the the skills that you've acquired get a job and not be in the situation where when you're 40 you're still paying off your college debt that is a that is something that people do not have to do it is it is because of choices they make if you had college debt that was extremely expensive and you were paying $100 more than your minimum you don't stay in debt until you're 40 you get out of debt but it's $100 more than your minimum people pay the minimum and and think that you know oh it'll be fine but that's why they get into these or that's part of the reason why they get into the economic problems that they get into and speaking of jobs with untenable uh amounts of income coming in we have a couple of other stories T of two teachers a tale of two teachers teachers who have been fired from their jobs well let's rephrase that one was one was fired the other one resigned uh so technically different things the first one here is a twitch streamer who was fired from his teaching job uh after ex Guild members reportedly contacted his school with examples of him cursing on stream but that's not all not only do we have that that's like a tame that is like the tamest way to to lose your job ever now but we also have this story about a teacher who joined only fans due to her low salary well she resigned when the school found out so it's kind of crazy that these uh that that both of these paths lead you to the same conclusion right let's play the video from the guy yeah hold on no but I'm I'm okay to say it now um so like to my streaming Community my my dad was department chair uh at the school uh that I that I taught it um and so like honestly the hardest part about about the day was like like you know you go up to your dad you're like I'm sorry what is he crying about losing his job I'm sorry because he swore on Street yeah if you have a if you have allow those type of people into your community going to turn on you you should do everything gatekeeping is good keep those people away from you because they will destroy your life for entertainment because look at how good I am to point out that that guy was bad it gives them a feeling of moral superiority gatekeep as much as you can keep people like that away from you out of your communities away from you as much as possible but if you're a teacher uh should you be a public figure on social media like is that except acceptable well it's like we we covered the story last week of the the police officer who got who had the only fans account there's a there's a police officer who pulled the guy over and the guy she pulled over recognized her from only fans and basically said like I don't recognize your Authority anymore like similarly if your high school English teacher has an only fans account I don't think your students are going to have much respect for you as an authority figure so like you're to your question Mary I don't think it's a problem if you're streaming and you doing topics that relate to your job so like you're an English teacher when you're streaming talking about your job or the thing that you're into be that's fine um you probably should not be on only fans if you're a teacher that is that is pretty clear a teacher in Missouri has handed in her resignation after she was suspended from her job when her school found out she had an only fans account with only fans rising in popularity over the recent years many people have taken to the content creation as a way of making extra money for St Clair high school English teacher Brianna uh is it copage I I don't know if it's a but she revealed that her teacher salary was about 42,000 and this is essentially making the story like Pay Teachers more so that they don't have to become online prostitutes and the only thing more annoying than a than a than an entertainment Union is a teachers union oh the teachers unions are awful they're they're part of the reason why why half the people that graduate from school can't read at a a college at a high school level so like the shows that the writers and actors are involved in aren't making money similarly the teachers are not bringing kids to a point where they can read when they go to college because there's no they're not held to any standard their results are not yeah exactly that they're not providing the results that they're hired to provide for kids what is like the incentive like I guess like could it be like if a teacher was to um this is so off topic but like if a teacher was to like show strong like grades amongst her students would that be like a chance for her to be able to get a job at like a prestigious private school or something you know what I'm saying possi like what what's the incentive to actually make sure that your students are doing well well there's not really an incentive because the incentive is to move them along you can see you can see yeah you can see teachers and this is because of George Bush and No Child Left Behind the idea of No Child Left Behind was we don't want kids to fall behind so we're going to do things to make sure they fall beh they don't fall behind but what it turned into to is we are not allowed to fail kids they have to move through so we just hustle them on out the door yeah we have a $20 Super Chat here from Gordon Shumway says Phil don't forget the snowplow part of the helicopter parenting these parents also do all of the hard work for the children it's admirable but it denies uh a kid's ability to develop resiliency as adults they can't handle anything that's what I was thinking when I said uh making the world flat for them you don't make the world flat for kids you don't knock everything out of the way for them you give them the ability to function in the world so they can deal with the ups and downs of life and and the things that are going to be you know that that take a little bit of effort to get through that's how it was I mean for in my in my house like we were not you know given everything I I'd like to think that my family was pretty good about letting me you know succeed where I succeeded and failed where I failed like I don't feel like that any of that really happened with me so it says she explained that the sa the to the St Louis uh the St Louis Post Dispatch that the reason she had thank you yeah um is there something wrong with my uh is there something wrong with my shot here is there something wrong with it look at the bottom of it it's weird looks fine there yeah it looked like it was artifacting okay that's weird thank you yep that's that was Phil sh yeah so uh she says hold on there we go fixed she says that uh to the St Louis Post Dispatch that the reason she had only fans over the summer break was to help supplement her second year summer job remember in uh Mean Girls when Tina Fay works at TGI Fridays on the weekends and her students are really freaked out by it imagine the only fans t-shir that's amazing she's like like literally she puts like a back next summer post up every uh every time she's about to go uh back to teaching she's like look I got papers to grade I can't be putting out content right now plus we we did have that one where the teacher who did have like school like teacher based only fans content yeah that was like and people had a really big problem with that rightfully it sounds like this isn't the same but you don't even need to show your face anyway yeah why did she show her face there is there are uh Instagram continuously puts those uh the those kind of things in my feet and there's one woman that has a lot of like teacher stuff and I'm like that's really gross yeah it's like really there's a $20 one here from weary traveler says I only watch when Phil is on a well thank you how do you know though that's um that that hurt my feelings a little bit but that's that's fine I get it I get it right that that's fine do you do you think this is like okay so somebody last week mentioned that there was an episode recently of Blue Bloods where a cop has an only fans wait yes okay so Not only was that a real story that that was a real episode it was this season at the end of the episode apparently from what the synopsis said I went back and checked they basically say that it's okay like and it's it's totally out of character for every character on that show to just be especially for Frank Reagan the you know the head of the family who's been a cop for like 50 gazillion years he's the police commissioner like it's completely out of character to say that something like that would be okay and to not see the pitfalls of what would happen uh when essentially your ability to hold any level of authority over someone has been kind of forfeited because of something like this it's not hard to see that that's how Hollywood socially Engineers things a certain direction little by little if we lived in in my utopian dictatorship people with only fans would be thrown in jail that's what Mary would do I don't it's actually jail I think it's the pit that the uh from 300 that's how long would the Mary would be kicking them in there look we'll figure that out when I get into Power okay she said she further added I do not regret joining only do any of these women be like yes I I changed my mind I regretted it when they actually do something wrong they either don't regret it or afterwards they're like look I had to forgive myself it's always that right it's always it's like it's like uh my husband and me broke up sure I took him for half his money like I had to for I cheated on my husband and it was really hard to forgive myself yes that's all it's women are always okay that's I don't want to lump all women into one one category but it's not all it's just that the fact of the matter is that the ones that want to go ahead and tell people like when they do something terrible they always want to tell people so they can justify it I really think that's what Pride parades are yeah yeah maybe I mean those are they tend to be gross too but um well I think that's one of the things that that women want to do is like they want to feel justification they need to talk more than men do so instead of internalizing things they say okay well I'm going to tell my story and I'm going to come up with whatever lame brain excuse that I can come up with to make to justify what I've done and that's why people hear these stories of women doing these terrible things because they want to tell people that look I'm not actually a bad person even though I was banging three dudes on the side and blah blah blah or whatever it's like it's not that there are the majority of women that do it it's just that the women that do do it want to talk about it they want to be able to to say look this is it this is what happened let me explain feel bad for me I'm not doing anything bad that's the that's why it seems like oh people women are always doing this no women are not always doing this women are just always talking about it men when they do stuff like that they don't tell their friends they don't need to justify it they don't need to get a a you know a minseries about their struggles because they were banging chicks you know so does that make sense to you yeah okay she says I do not regret joining only fans I know it can be taboo or some people may believe that it's shameful but I don't think sex work has to be shameful I do just wish things just happened in a different way well uh maybe because she like is there a reason you didn't go to your school board and say like look I I'm I was thinking of doing this in the off seon shame is that okay like because she wouldn't do that because shameful it's kind of like when a kid does something that he knows his parents wouldn't approve of but he's he's going to he's going to beg forgiveness not ask permission if you get caught yep I guess so you know uh lify does it have a particular uh incentive for teachers or something like I I feel like this story I've seen similar stories over and over again they have time CU they have they don't I mean it it doesn't take you don't have a full day of work or whatever it's like you know I guess I think my favorite type of prop three months a year off four months a year off yeah uh I think my favorite type of propaganda is when they talk about how they don't get paid in the summer but everyone knows that you can have your salary stretch so that that you can get checks over the summer rather than taking them all yeah yeah yeah uh party count is not showing up right now but that's okay I'll have to look into that and see if we can get that fixed it may be a problem for tomorrow but we are currently ladies and gentlemen at one crisis party right now oh Uno crisis party one one crisis party right now now let's see if it's back there back we're good yeah fixed it I'm a I'm a genius ladies and gentlemen I'm a genius all right what would you like to see would you like to see cute of the day or cringe of the day what do you think Phil cringe first let's go oh the cringe is bad too so um we can't the is the cute good the cutees good but we should do cringe first and get it over with um we can't play the music on this because we'll get copyrighted but um Libby or should we just play it and then I can edit it out later uh you kind of need the music to understand how how gross this video is oh God I saw it saw this okay here we go ladies and gentlemen if you didn't see this uh be thankful but here we go uh if you're looking if you're wondering if you're listening there's a a young lady she's wearing a hoodie uh and the room is changing colors and it says my fetus dancing right before it was aborted back like a him to the CRI then I push him on the have his breath smelling like [ __ ] somehow and it's from an account called at the abortion counselor somehow the smile counselor somehow the smile makes it more demonic it's so repulsive this is what this is exactly what you were talking about though the the fact that women need to broadcast their L's like this they really do because I don't um I don't call a lot of things evil but I would actually kind of put this close to evil so I for a long time I didn't think e i when I was growing up I kind of was like okay good and evil are real things and then I was like well maybe not maybe it's perspective and blah blah blah and now I don't feel that way anymore and and I don't think that like like when someone says demonic or whatever like I'm not talking about or I don't hear there's a spiritual connection to it because for me I don't believe in an afterlife or anything like that I don't believe in ghosts but I do believe that people in history have looked at things and said this behavior is X and they're just using these words to describe the behavior as opposed to there there doesn't have to be a spiritual connection or or you don't have to believe in ghosts to believe that evil is real or or that that you know insane people are behave like demonic people or whatever you know like and what's scary is like it this is this would be like an almost exclusively female phenomenon right like are there guys no there's not like a guy who's like me when I when I found out that she was willing to have an abortion and then it's this video of a guy doing it no I mean I'm sure it's happened once or twice but I also saw the video the the video of that trans Guy saying that he wants to be the first transom to have an abortion I mean evil is everywhere is really gross and I understand why societies essentially leading up to maybe the past 50 to 100 years essentially every society in the world was extremely brutal I it makes sense to me now it's like uh the last the last uh year has kind of made that more apparent over and over again it used to be where I could I could be like oh you know maybe societies that were brutal and and chopped off heads and blah blah blah maybe it wasn't so good and I'm just well maybe it wasn't so bad either you know you know what it is also is like I look at that and that is the woman I I bet you nine times out of 10 the women who make that video have be kind in their profile oh God it costs nothing to have empathy it costs nothing it it doesn't cost you anything to be kind it's like but the abortion cost you 52.95 and uh I have no idea but like that's it's just gross and it's it's just uh it shows you where society's headed and way that uh kind of scares the crap out of me all right uh let's do cute of the day pallet cleansers pallet cleanser guys if you have cute of the day you can send them in on Twix please at me on there Brett dvic popculture show as well hpcc pets if you want to be featured on there this one here is from Lindsay Tatum says all this pumpkin spice convo led me to led me to light a pumpkin bourbon candle up in the bedroom and the most basic bee showed up it's Eddie or is it Edie uh as in Edith breto Edie I'm guessing uh the outside rescue even she thinks it's nice there she is right there sitting in the corner cute that is very cute that is very cute uh and one more so guys uh send those in for tomorrow because we need some some more cute of the day for tomorrow this is from Leroy Dean keading says um White Flame Point Siamese is Oliver his Tabby Spirit bonded sister is Gracie Spirit bonded in the sense just means that they imprinted on each other and often one is not far from the other oh they're so cute it's so funny when they like sometimes cats hate each other they either hate each other or they're Inseparable that's so cute or is it that one hates the other and the other one wants to be friends kind of like a a like the younger brother just wants to hang out with the older brother and the older brother's like get away from meh uh now people in the chat are saying mocha the derpy cat yes uh mocha the derpy cat what about M what about mocha well mocha mocha has a sister I'm guessing the sister probably just doesn't like her because she's Derpy that would be my that would be my guess just saying all right guys let's go ahead and get started then since uh now that we've kind of man that that um that cringe of the day really set the mood Mary tell us what the hell's going on with Dylan Maly a queer magazine called attitude just voted Dylan Mulaney woman of the year and we have the video of Dylan mulan's acceptance speech for this award it's literally the worst thing ever and you know actually Dylan mulany was already voted breakout Creator at the streamy awards this year and similarly that acceptance speech was just a big pity party about how much hate he's got how much work there is left to do how much work there is left to do you know and this is the same way so I guess we should react to it here one of the things before it really set you on a on a tail spin one of the things yeah that I want to mention before we get started is it's it's one of them these really interesting things because I think Dylan Mulin might be the best emotional blackmailer in the history of the world in in a lot of ways and it's it it makes me uneasy in a way that I actually can't put into words which is not very good when your job is literally supposed to be it almost makes you feel like the audience for this speech in this room feels better about giving the award to Dilly than Dylan feels about getting the award yes they're getting the satisfaction out of that win let's uh let's listen to this speech the woman of the year award supported by Virgin Atlantic goes to Dylan muli first of all I want to say like you want to know how you know it's a pandering event because they said the winner of the award sponsored by Virgin Atlantic yeah like what hello London I am so honored to be here with you all tonight and you know some see me as the woman of the year some see me as a woman of a year and some change as I only publicly came out online 560 days ago and some people don't see me as a woman at all me I know which is why receiving this honor from a queer publication like attitude means so much more to me because here's what I've realized you ready okay so no matter how hard I try or what I wear or what I say or what surgeries I get I will never reach an acceptable version of Womanhood by those hateful people's standards I mean hateful that's no by reality standards that's point one right that's immediately framing anyone that disagrees with you as a bad person and is hateful I I want you to pay attention to the Linguistics in this this is a m masterly worded guilt trip on the entire population it's actually it's scary like I do find this to be scary it's worded to Pat the people in the audience On The Backs yes because they they're there to feel morally Superior oh yeah as long as I have the queer community that sees me for my truth I'm going to be okay truth here's my truth and I'm equally grateful that this title is happening in the UK hey and not just because I am deeply attracted to your accents which I am but because I came to London on holiday this summer after months of feeling isolated and when I arrived I I didn't feel that baggage that I was carrying back in the US and I didn't feel like the trans beer girl you know I I I didn't walk into rooms and wonder oh does that person hate me um I I was just another that's just an that's just a comment on your own narcissism walking into any room and thinking do do people here hate me is just wondering do people here think I'm important there's a $20 one from Dreamcast night says Dylan sounds like Quagmire's father after the sex change on the bright side Seth Farland would hit it um there's uh there's something to me about treating actual Womanhood like uh SI as they would call it CIS Womanhood as like a perverse costume that you can win an award for is disturbing in a way like I'm a woman I'm I'm not getting any awards for simply being a woman yeah it's I mean I mean this really all started with Caitlyn Jenner winning call me Caitlyn well winning winning Woman of the Year first year and winning woman of the year and hypocritically after the fact going uh to Twitter to talk about how actually biological women deserve their own spaces they deserve their own sports Le Sports as long as it's Sports and not Awards where I get celebrated right super hypocritical bberry trended on her way to a West End Musical and you know I I romanticized this country as a safe place and as dangerous everything is couched in the language of victimhood yeah every inch of it for Trans people here right now like the hate that was spewed last week I don't know what it's less about where we are and more about who we're with and that if I'm surrounded by people like you all that this still can be one of my safe spaces so we're not entitled to any of that nobody is no human being is when you have a win for Trans rights that's a win for us back in the states too and I think if we all just adopt a girls girl mentality and we say goodbye to the scarcity complexes that we have a better chance of get a man is going to tell us what a girl's girl mentality is yeah and in the also the talk about the scarcity mindset and what Dylan is about to get into with like you know women are being pitted against each other women are told that they're in competition with me Dylan mulany uh yeah no I no woman no biological woman ever felt that she was in competition with you Dylan that's ridiculous through this because they want us to be in competition with each other they would love nothing more than to see the L's and the B's and the G's turn their backs on the t's and to quote the critically acclaimed High School Musical franchise We're All in This Together I know almost as profound as Shakespeare but I I wanted to give a quick shout out to some of the girls girls in my life okay let's the rest of it is just you know the thanking people there is um a certain level of um of skill that it takes to to manipulate a crowd like that that is he's the Dylan's a performer at heart was Broadway um and it it really does feel like I as somebody I don't remember who it was said like they feel like he's like a performance artist that's doing this on like a a large scale right and it feels more and more like that every day that it's not that it's not an identity it's it's a very very elaborate performance that's being done in all the world is a stage I feel like Dylan could have garnered some more good faith discussion if he had responded to the criticisms of his uh 365 days of girlhood Series in an honest way if he had engaged those criticisms um but he never did he just you know labeled all of it as ignorance hatred baseless bigotry there's also the like the criticism was you're you're making uh Womanhood into a character specifically you're infantilizing women you're calling it days of girlhood especially like and and prancing around in frilly dresses acting like Eloise at the Plaza and you're defining those trappings the lipstick and the heels and the dresses it's just a costume as you're you're yeah you are manipulating that costume as the definition of Womanhood that was the criticism and and he never engaged with it honestly there's a $20 one there from aites oo uh says Dylan who's they though oh yeah Dylan also later in the speech talked about you know living life off the binary like dude you identify as a woman right say a woman existing off the binary those are those are mutually exclusive things because a woman is part of the gender binary what you're saying you are is something off the off that scale so the the the fact that it's all designed to be as confusing as possible so that you just give in and say well fine they probably mean well I don't agree that most that everyone just blanket means well I think that there's a lot of insidiousness uh in the ones who like not not in the ones who do it in of their own private life but the ones who seek to profit from it heavily the ones who seek to raise uh you know your status the the stat where they are in the status quo seek to raise their profile I think that there is a certain amount of kind of um designed evil there to pit people against each other on the you know the genders against each other for the sake of profit in something like this and it's just uh it's not good um it's so evil that you don't even know how to attack it or how to articulate why it unsettles you but it's just like that sound of screeching echoing through the room and Dylan's manic face that it like it's a disembodying level of evil and that's from someone me and you have convers me and you have conversations a lot about where we sit uh in our beliefs and people bring that up a lot right like I still consider myself in many ways to be very much uh a liberal in in most cases with most things but there is something about this that I can't put my finger on as to why it uh unsettles me so much well I mean because they're it's not real I mean all the trans stuff it's not real it's all in my opinion it's it's just you know the the rest of society um affirming mental illness you know like and and so I I think that we're most people are are kind of off-put by that the people that aren't are the people that are ideologically you predisposed to be leftists or or on the left side so people are women though like it should be noted that Dylan's rise to fame and success and brand deals it's fueled by women and our pathological desire to affirm you know affirm like yeah like affirm the broken welcome open our doors to the marginalized or those who are perceived to be marginalized in society to displace our maternal instincts on to uh you know yeah the the the people who are perceived as weaker than us and the way it fits into pop culture is like it's almost a perfect storm of birth rates dropping social media becoming as popular and as common as it is women being more predisposed to it on to liking social media uh than men and then having these figures exist in the cultural space to then pluck at all of those things together and turn it into something that I don't think the average business person even even want thinks that it's going to turn into they just want to make a profit Virgin Airlines or whoever the hell sponsored that isn't thinking about the downfall of Western Civilization they're thinking about how can we look good as a Fortune 500 company for this yep like and there's just something about it that's just it's deeply unsettling to me and I can't and I don't think I'll ever be able to really reconcile what that is and a lot of what it is is it this was an event for lgbtqi plus group fine but if this is to happen to uh like somebody like Caitlyn Jenner when it's not just uh an lgbtq magazine but it's just a magazine cover for all women it really does laugh in the face of biological thank you thank you there's a $20 one here from Gordon shamway sorry buddy I didn't see this one says Dylan is a genius says Dylan is a genius figured out how to mansplain to women with without getting called out because transs uh and women will not only listen they will cheer you on this could have been a Bud Light Real Men of Genius uh well played yes I do miss the Real Men of Genius commercials those were fantastic those were Fant I mean women are just never going to put their foot down to stop this nope so we're just going to see how how far these depths of insanity go it is crazy that women won't like no it's not it's not crazy if you think about women's inherent nature like they're not capable of going against the group think they have this collectivist mindset and I but they're not but the thing is like women got the vote by convincing men that they needed to get the vote or they deserve to get the vote which is more of by a shame tactic fair enough but why aren't they why aren't women shaming men into stopping this then because they do have the the ability men do what women want I don't care what anyone says everyone talks about like men like are are in charge or run the sh run the room blah blah blah and men are the ones that are actively doing things in the world all of it is because of women like all the things men do is to make the world safe for their women and children that's why like they want to there are an exceedingly few ultra high performing dudes that go out there and want to like beat everybody and blah blah blah but the vast majority of men do what they do to make women happy and that is that's why our society now is so it's why we have air conditioning look if you listen to the guy that created the guy that created I think it was tampons like he went through a huge massive pain in the ass to make tampons and he didn't do it for him he did it for for his wife or whatever it's like these men do things because they want to make women happy because we are we are inherently designed by nature to want to make women happy you know and that type of guilt tactic usually works uh men have made society so comfortable and safe for women to make it a habitable environment for growing families we got so comfortable that we had nothing to do and we started thinking ourselves into this type of insanity that's my biggest problem with feminism feminism feminists and and women that are that tend to hate men they either think all men are their dad or they think all men are the president and it's like they don't think they never think of the guys that are getting up and cutting trees or going out and and working on the sewers or you know dudes that are out there restoring the power when it's freezing cold or when it's pouring rain or whatever like it's all men do all the hard jobs and then women have the audacity and it's not not all women it's the the feminist and stuff but feminists have the audacity to [ __ ] about men as if that as if all men are all ultimately powerful it's like they're bitching because the tail end of a bell curve is all men shut the hell up it is something that I think all of us could do better would be to to get away from the generalizations it has to be done in conversations like this a lot of times because it's a it's a way to kind of push the discussion forward you can't stop every single time to say not all this not all that even if it would be beneficial possibly to do so but I think everybody falls into those traps right where you give these generalized descriptions and then the society is the worst for it that's why I try and say point to feminists as opposed to women like it's not all women it's feminists and it's it's women that have that attitude well some people say that because of the way women are raised all of them are feminists now well I don't think they all have feminist attitudes even if they don't identify with that political movement I think that there's some truth to that but I I think that the I don't think Trad women kind of think like that but there are but there there might be an argument that you know that it's it's you know more pre prevalent than I'm you know giving credit to it but that is still at the root of it that's the situation you know women feminist women that hate men feminists and stuff they act like all men are either the president or their dad and that's it it's like there's nobody that there's no dudes that are you know that are just downtrod and just trying to get by just trying to make their their families happy you know it's like that doesn't happen at all know what makes me think about like just think about like think about how bad it is the Pol like whenever like we elect a new president and then the other side is like that you know Joe Biden does something stupid and was like oh my God the Democrats are all evil and then Trump gets not oh my gosh the Republicans are all evil just think what's going to happen when there actually is a female president and it just goes like see what happens ladies and gentlemen we elect a woman and now we're at war in the Middle East as if we weren't already at war in the Middle East Generations beforeand but you know that that's going to happen we're going like those discussions are going to be everywhere look at what happened with Barack Obama there's a ton of people that like with like an inkling of racism in that are just like oh look Barack Obama blah blah blah and and the thing is it's hard to talk about the legitimately awful things that because of that it's really tough to talk about the legitimately bad things I talk about this on on timcast all the time Barack Obama signed a bill that made it okay for the federal government to propagandize the American people it's called the smithm modernization act smithm act initially said you can't the state department can't create uh materials to disseminate inside the us as and the point of that is the government doesn't get to have an opinion about the government the government reflects the will of the people now because Barack Obama signed that NDA in 2012 the government can produce material that is disseminated into the United States and it happened just at the same time that a cell phone or the basically pocket computers reached Market saturation and the most powerful mind control device ever created was in everybody's pocket and now you've got if you talk to people so many people are like man in 2012 13 everything seemed to go start going crazy and since then people are like oh man the world is really crazy now blah blah blah it wasn't like that before blah blah blah well there is a whole generation of people that are now turning 18 19 2021 that don't have a significant memory of pre that so all they know is this crazy partisanship and stuff and I think a lot of it is D is driven by the fact that the federal government is propagandizing people constantly in their with the cell phones and with with social media you talk about the FBI had a desk at Twitter you know they have a desk at Google you know they have a desk at uh at Facebook it's like that's exactly what it was like when the stazzy in East Germany existed like that's what happens in China every single business has a CCP desk and there's a person that works for the the government in every business and it's like that's what's happening in America and most people are are almost unaware of it yep all right let's go to super chats we got some up there Francisco Sanchez Jr said oh sorry that's a $20 arvar said Talking Taco Bell talk for last couple episodes I went to Taco Bell after 3 years now Taco Bell is the city's problem Taco Bell how do you feel about Taco Bell Phil I love Taco Bell what do you get I tend to get the steak quesadillas and then just the regular crunchy tacos The Supremes with with the uh tomatoes and cream cheese are delicious Mary what do you get um you can you you you mix it up yeah I mix it up oh really they change the the menu so frequently I find it difficult to know for sure what I like so I tend to go back to the well because those are the things that I'm really into I don't want Fritos and everything they start like they got a deal with with with uh laser or whatever now everything Taco Bell makes has either Fritos or Doritos inside of it and I don't want that [ __ ] inside of it I think my favorite was um somebody somebody said like Taco Bell is the only place the only fast food place that I go to where I Just Vibe where he goes he's like like every other fast food place I go to I know exactly what I'm getting before I go there Taco Bell I look at the menu and just let it take me where it takes me yeah I mean the thing is here's what you do you you get I call it a backup Burger but you can it works at anywhere you get something that you know you like and then you also get something that's an experiment so that way if the experiment fails and you hate it you've got your backup burger and you know two cheeseburgers and whatever the the funky weird thing that you want to get at the at the burger place but you know the cheeseburgers are going to be good so you got your backup Supreme taco taco supreme well I mean you get more than mine's the Crunch Wrap Crunch Wrap smart sh Wilder said first they go after Phil with a fank account now Mary this indiscretion will not stand not on my watch thank you Shane H Wilder for uh always first for the memes and second for uh standing up for them tati platty said Phil the best failed musician keep it up yes uh do one more do quiet anari um name of daily live Rosary Reading from YouTube It's called Rosary crew with Keith Nester there you go all right Mary tell us what's going on with Bobby altright Bobby althoff now being called Bobby altright is a podcaster her podcast is called the really good podcast and she has gotten a lot of hate for her dry awkward sense of humor she tries to exaggerate awkward silences with her guests do you like do you like that type of humor does that work for you no I hate it and a lot of people hate it um she's gotten really big guests on her podcast that raised alarm bells for people calling her an industry plant the first of those was Drake and it just seemed to pop up out of nowhere then she got signed by Drake's talent agency and uh now she's getting accused of racism and the reason for that is people believe she is building her podcasting career off of appropriating Black Culture interviewing black celebrities and people who are in the rap and hipop world when she doesn't really understand or appreciate it and uh she capitalizes off of just kind of being around black people and looking uncomfortable I guess that's basically her her stick that is Hollywood in a nutshell like Hollywood writers in a nutshell I totally buy that I do what do you mean okay so that like a lot of people will talk about how they have like a tendency to like feminize black men in hwood yeah like I I totally buy it that this is it's interesting that Drake went on her podcast just because he never does interviews notoriously and has extreme control over the His Image yeah his his media presence and His Image he doesn't let anything go to air without his complete approval and control so it seemed weird that he just hopped on the podcast with this random person we've never heard of before and then she signed to his agency and this agency doesn't have any clients that are podcasters yeah it it so it does make her seem like an industry plant but her story is that she's self-made woman and the point of this clip is that so she does this interview she interviews Scarlet Johansson which is really weird another person why is Scarlett Johansson doing this her agent told her like this is what's hot right now you need to do this so she breaks character at least seems to break character in her interview with Scarlett Johansson she's like fixing her hair they're doing girl talk and then uh everyone is like oh so she only breaks character when she's around white people because she feels uncomfortable around black people is that what's going on I don't think what they're saying is fair I don't like I think I think it's completely plausible that maybe she just is like a really big Scarlet Johansson fan maybe I don't know like I'm just I'm just saying there there's more than one explanation for something like this that could be% let's uh yeah we'll we'll play play for uh Phil when he gets when he gets back so here we go here's that clip here you use this it's all I use that's it yeah it's in that bag over there if you want to take anything else out of it feel free actually before we go on I I have comments about the glasses look not hoodie and the glasses and the bun you don't need the serial killer glasses if you're Scarlet Johansson could you just wear some regular glasses please like you don't need the serial kill glasses uh like as I've told this story before look I was once forced to wear those glasses as a punishment the the glasses with stylish now the glasses with the bar across the top Phil have you ever seen those right so when I was younger I was basically told like cuz I kept breaking all my glasses and my dad said you will get only these glasses unless you make these last at least a year um so the fact that somebody would choose these willingly is actually insulting to me I'm highly offended basically yeah right so oh that's even worse oh that's another thing look well look the girl Like Scarlett Johansson's hot so fake glasses is also like I I think people should wear fake hearing aids like are fake you know if you're going to pretend to have a disability you should wear F like I'm I'm like I'm about to buy blue blocker glasses for like wearing in the evening before I go to bed okay you know because it's supposed to help you sleep better um but is that like at of hand I don't I don't all I'm saying is when when I see somebody with perfect 2020 vision that's never had to just Brett's very offended I'm very offended I'm deeply offended at the idea that somebody would uh wear my disability as a mask as a costume I'm I'm I just I can't take it and frankly I'm Going To Raise Hell go get lasic yeah well I I I mean actually I have considered that but it's just like making the time for it and I've gotten like it's one of those things where it's like you should wait for somebody to give you like I want to get five good like um like recommendations in a row I don't want if I get to three and then the fourth person every time says no don't do it I feel like I need to get five in a row that tell me that it's a good idea it's the best thing that I it's the best thing that I ever did is getting lasic so or one of the best things not the best thing all right let's listen to this interview so so Phil uh people are mad because Bobby alof did this interview with Scarlett Johansson and she broke character so they think what is they think that she Bobby aloff is only comfortable about around white people because she's racist here we go you use this yeah it's all I use that's it yeah it's in that bag over there if you want to take anything else out of it thank you so much they were telling me there's like something for slicked back sure you could slick back your hair or you can use the this this can I put some of that on your hair cuz there's a piece that's like is there yeah would you I would love to thank you thank you why is it driving you crazy a little bit your hair is very smooth you know I had a hair person come and do mine oh I didn't but I didn't know I could just use this like this is why she's racist there look at that is it better that's amazing not bad right wait look at that it's like smoother oh it's like perfect is it yeah that was really thank you you should do like a little before and after well can you see can you get the little hairs from there yeah you had like a whole bunch of flyaways no that's a piece that was just like huge and just not looking crazy I could keep going I just wanted to fix the front CU that was the only part so she does seem a little bit like she's like and she does this for 3 hours and people watch this like for fun that's crazy yeah to me like that's incredibly boring but um yeah top comment literally says so she hat she just hated colored people all along so this quote tweet said Landing an interview with a white woman and immediately dropping her entire gimmick and just being nice instead is so insane her gim is her gimmick her gimmick is just to be slightly rude to be awkward play into the interview being awkward she does know anything awward when like touching people's head is kind of awkward like yeah I thought that video was sufficiently awkward but they're saying that she's being too nice maybe maybe SC Johansson just kind of dealt with it well no yeah I think she played I think she she knew how to like she was actually trying to get her to lean into it and she wasn't leaning into it yeah when she's interviewed rappers they kind of try to push back on her and they take it a little too personally uh actual Justice Warrior Shan has this this saying that the the supply of racism isn't nearly enough to meet the demand and that's factually true I made a joke about or not a joke but I made a comment about me Anda and I was like look at those eyebrows and within moments someone was on Twitter and someone was like that's kind of racist and I was like shut up and I laugh I was just like laughed at him and I was like and I tweeted retweeted his tweet and made fun of him because that's what you need to do when people accuse you of racism if you're not racist don't accept that someone's don't accept someone's accusation like if you're just just like oh I don't hate anyone like I'm just making a comment don't just ignore people or mock them when they call you racist because that's the only way we're going to get past this idea that every single basically um what's the word microaggression is some kind of awful affront to an entire group of people it's ridiculous and the more we ignore it and mock people that make those kind of accusations the better off Society is going to be a $20 one here from the uh I can't read the whole name here but it looks like can you see the whole name there Mary um the manic mustache said hey gang late as always but appropo to short Kings my wife told me she almost didn't go out on our second date because I lied about my height I put 56 in my profile but I'm really 56 and 3/4 she was just a little disappointed oh so you were like you you rounded down good for you buddy that's true don't don't don't lie about it true lie about it that whole tweet was a lie but it was worth 20 bucks so um so here are some of the insane responses the the respon are insane yeah Bobby althoff's entire gimmick has always felt racist to me the clips of her Scarlet Johansson interview is a perfect example another one said stop giving Bobby althof interviews with black artists look at this BS she's not being odd or weird she's engaging and not being disrespectful stop giving this [ __ ] views her racist ass used these black artists get views for treating them as if they stink another one said Bobby alof type of racist white Blas like what even is hip-hop post ironic attitude towards Black Culture still being obsessed with engaging in it is so prominent in alt and hipster circles in the early 2000s where people just not there for it or did y'all forget it's uh it does feel like that I mean it kind of like you said it feels like an offshoot of like Aubrey Plaza who just did better humor was just better anyways yeah another one said Bobby alof thinks she's Nathan Fielder except she's not funny and probably racist also remember that was like a 30 second clip of a three-hour interview someone commented what if she touched a black woman's hair like that that would have really gotten her or even made com I mean or made comments about it at all yeah like that would have gotten extreme backlash from her on that so another one said bro how and why the [ __ ] is Bobby althoff famous I can't stand her most milk toast racist Nathan Fielder wannabe ass MF I've ever seen it's so ridiculous why is she popular though because her podcast sucks I think objectively do you think she's an industry plant do you is in so much as that term can be in that that term can be apped even Drake has been called a an industry plant like anything that allows anything that the mainstream machine pushes to have succeed would technically be kind of an industry plant right right I just think that the accusation resonates more with her because her podcast isn't good like you could call Drake an industry plant but you can't say that his music wasn't genuinely good and popular because no no no no you can you can make there's plenty of people that could make the argument that it's not good but you can't say that it's not popular the same would actually be fair to say about her she's got a lot of views so yes uh she she could be considered an industry plant in so far as they're saying that it doesn't feel like it is a natural following she has views because of the guests not because of her like I don't see the appeal in her gimmick I don't think it's racist I just think it's not funny um another but that is subjective right like there are tons of people that like it and that's fine but it it's just that it's it's a bit of a mystery here because it doesn't appeal to us which is fine but like you said it's Landing all of those guests right away right without really having a digital footprint that shows the work that showed you leading up to that then she interviewed Lil yachty Then She interviewed offset and all of these different people who are like seemingly Untouchable unreachable and they're also mad at those rappers that they haven't done interviews with black interviewers like Breakfast Club you know which is kind of ridiculous like you can't tell someone who like what they should do for for their interviews no like I like like for something like this I I have a hard time I I have a i I completely disagree with the with the assessment that they're making that what she did was in any way racist I think that's ridiculous I do have a hard time like judging the outset of like the show being a plant because it's like the the guest part yes the part about it about the guest just magically appearing and getting all that work sure and her getting signed like a week later yeah but but the idea that it's not popular or doesn't resonate is kind of silly because the views unless we're saying that those views were bought or those views are are are Bots then then it's just look the world has billion people in the world there's bound to be a couple million that like that type of humor her gimmick more than um being racist it's more like a I'm not like other girls stick like she did a video at a Drake concert where these girls were dancing and she's just standing there with her arms crossed looking unimpressed and then she also does a video where she's at a strip club and there are these dancers around her and people throwing money and she's doing the same thing where she crosses her arms and looks like not uncomfortable but like full of contempt somebody made an interesting point they said that she wants like all these people doing this gimmick want to be Daria um it's yeah it's Daria it's Nathan Fielder it's Aubrey Plaza would her podcast do well if it was just her no cuz I mean it's not the format I mean she was relatively successful making Tik toks with that were like Mom content you know nothing wrong with that like some people are saying people misunderstand her gimi because uh they say her character isn't based on her being white and not knowing Black Culture it's based on her being a mom who isn't familiar with any pop culture uh don't ruin a good thing yeah it says uh if you think Bobby olhoff is racist it just proves people don't want to see a mom succeed so so anybody can claim victimhood from any angle like unless you're like a straight white dude you're you're you're good you got some angle you can run to and if you're a straight white dude like no one's going to care so just shut up and exact like do better uh might be the only time I've heard the term do better where it actually applies here's another rant Bobby aloff makes me deeply uncomfortable the premise of her whole gig is acting uncomfy around black people who aren't dressed preppy and cod switching for her I hate it so much it's not new or fresh apart from being racist is it comedy to act like your ignorant Grandma also I'm sorry but it's not a talent to have a scowl on your face everywhere she's an effing nobody who has access to all these celebs and thinks it's so cool to have a holier than thou demeanor like grow up this isn't entertaining in the least but that's the thing that's a subjective the last part is subjective opinion I find it more annoying when interviewers fawn over the person that they're interviewing like oh you're so iconic like no the there's nothing worse than those old like Entertainment Tonight interviews on the red carpet where it's like you can tell that that woman has wrote at least one mean thing about that person behind their back to someone in a group chat or on or on Twitter right it's like uh they said that who who are we talking about recently where they did an interview with her and she says like and and everyone knows this is so iconic I'm like why are you talking to this person like that there a human being talk to them like a human being it's not unless you're interviewing DOA cat and all she does is meow at you yes what are you supposed to do then that is that is I forgot I would enjoy that that'd be hilarious I want to actually I do want to see Bobby aloff interview DOA cat like Who who okay who can out irony each other there there's an interesting discussion like for her like for her manager or the people who line up her interviews where like they have to take her sense of humor her her style into account to figure out like who would be an interesting person I maybe they're looking for the person that wouldn't get it and is the most Fish Out of Water like what would Tom Cruz do in that situation I he like you're being disrespectful yeah like remember that that famous video of Tom Cruz telling off the uh interviewer that sprayed him with a water gun yeah he's like he's like how dare you why did you do that is is something wrong in your in your home life like do you have some kind of do you have some kind of trauma that tells you to make people uncomfortable in social situations imag like ruined this whole this guy's whole life like multi-millionaire Scientologist is just moral High grounding you insane hilarious they're also prophesying this controversy has gone so far that they are prophesying Bobby althoff's old racist tweets getting exposed to finally cancel her once and for all she doesn't have old racist tweets they just want her to have old racist tweets like they get off on it there's a $20 one here from boosted Yogi says I prefer the way Tim interviews celebrities and makes them walk off the show yeah how would Kanye deal with a bobby althof interview that would honestly be really really funny it wouldn't last long I'm sure I no no I I don't know know if I buy that I think that he might be able to like weird out weird in that situation like depending on how how disrespectful her joke comments were if they were disrespectful it would be it would be interesting to see how that what that would look like or maybe we could have her interview um Bianca sorri I think that Kanye would try to date Bobby aldof and uh get her a boob job there you go over a game of Uno yeah over a game of Uno he really that's some master Riz right there you're playing a game of Uno and he's like you want a boob job I'll pay for it do you think at one point like one of these like somebody from gen Z is GNA have to get in and like they're going to have to write current racist tweets to be like for future like in for posterity like I don't have any yet so I need to say them now so that in 20 years if I get famous somebody can use this against me I don't think she's 26 is she old enough to have old racist tweets she might not have been around long enough to have old racist tweet I said the most surprising thing about Bobby althoff is that she is married and has a couple of kids that's that's more rare What If She interviewed Joe Rogan ooh that would be weird yeah cuz he's too sincere and too invested yeah and she's too disconnected and cold MH be a recipe for really like but I I like cringe content I just don't find Bobby althof interviews cringe because it's manufactured yeah if it were an organic interaction that would be entertaining but their managers planned this someone's getting paid like we need to I'm surprised what they didn't invest in her and to do would be to do the like the on the street interviews like I feel like her type of humor would work better there's a British Bobby althof who has also been accused of racism her name's Amelia she does chicken shop dates she interviews oh yes yeah she interviews mostly black people at a chicken shop in the UK she's also been accused of the same thing she uses black celebrities to give her a platform when she herself is not that compelling but she got she has less hate because people find her more likable than Bobby aloff yeah uh I wonder if um Scarlet Johansson was just really good at rolling with the punches so it kind of screwed with the flow of it right like it seemed like Scarlet Johansson was trying to ease her back into her charact like she was trying to ease Bobby alof back into the Bobby alof character uh and Bobby alov didn't know how to do like what to do with that cuz Scarlett Johansson's been a you know a veteran actor for a long time and if she's been told the gig beforehand like this is the you need to go into it with no warning yeah kind of right like uh but that that might lead the problem with that is like you might get a bunch of reactions that are bad and then the interview gets canceled and you lose out on a bunch also a big name like Scarlet Janson she's not going to go into an interview with no warning like if I get put into an interview like I know who I'm talking to and I know what they're going to be talking about like and and I'm like you know a dude in a metal band never mind like someone that's an A-list actor well she ended up deleting her interview with Drake and they unfollowed each other on social media so not sure what happened there then then Dave pornoy was spreading this rumor that Bobby althof hooked up with Drake and is divorcing her husband that never happened very ridiculous very ridiculous all right uh let's go to Super Chat shall we Papa [ __ ] said name is from sit Adam show 149 where Chatters role played members of H's family some of my best Super Chat work Adam called me a comedy genius well you are a comedy genius nice Shane H Wilder said jalapeno chips for the win I don't do the jalapeno chips I like jalapenos Papa [ __ ] said Jada once tortured will with a massive dose of weed and a three part three party Siz bags of salt and vinegar chips that's like for a dude who makes his living in front of the camera that's kind of evil well I mean one bag is fine is that kind of evil Sparrow said hey Phil is there anything you can tell me about applying the RS notoria to music aspiring audio engineer and huge fan sorry just got my account back I cannot tell you anything about that I have no idea I'm not a producer one more yushima otaru said where is the teachers union for this guy F unions yeah exactly well the teachers union was was at fault for him getting fired so exactly yeah all right guys let's move on I want to talk a little bit about what's going on with the SAG strike we've just wrapped up they've officially ratified the Writers Guild strike but the SAG strike is still going strong and there's an article in variety today that says sag Afra bully alleges bully tactics as Studios suspend negotiations I find that funny because I consistently whenever we do any type of story that involves these unions I call them Union bullies cuz they are absolutely bullies they used bullying tactics on their own members they're they're cry bullies worse than anything and the big part that gets mentioned in this article so talks broke down after they thought they were going well it says in a statement to members after midnight the union accused Studios of engaging in Bully tactics and said that the studios had walked away from the bargaining Table after refusing to counter the Union's latest offer this is the most interesting part it says the key stumbling block is a union proposal to share in streaming Revenue with the am CP which would cost $800 million a year now that is the Studio's estimate of these Revenue sharing costs not the Union's uh estimate of what the revenue sharing cost would be it says we have negotiated with them in good faith despite the fact that last week they presented an offer that was shockingly worth less than they proposed before the strike began says the S uh seg after told membership these companies refuse to protect performers from being replaced by AI they refuse to increase your wages to keep up with inflation and they refuse to share a tiny portion of the immense Revenue your work generates for them sag after wants to share of streaming revenue for all Union covered shows both made for streaming and films and TV shows licensed from other platforms which would go well beyond the success-based bonuses won by The Writers Guild they don't we're not talking profit sharing we're talking people that have no Financial investment in these projects looking for Revenue sharing so that comes from what you called the big socialist pot of Revenue that Netflix keeps from all of their projects collectively yeah because because there's no re there's no ad based other than the ad most of that Revenue will come from people who subscribe to keep watching their most successful shows like stranger things yeah the on not to watch Warrior nun so any of the shows that are losing money are they're saying because they're covered by the union we should still get a share of revenue from projects other than our own which is the opposite of merit-based right it pushes away from so the The Writers Guild agreements seem to reward people for making actually good content like it it will reward people for good quality content finally when before that they didn't value Merit at all I don't mind the idea of like look look at give give some of these actors the ability to enter produc producer roles where they can invest in their projects right where they can they for Jenna Ortega on Wednesday exactly they should be doing that so that like look you want to share in the profits the revenue you should financially invest in the profit you that's what happens at a Fortune 500 company right you can work for a company like Disney but you can also buy stock in a company that you work for well yeah I mean like why aren't these compan it said that sag Afra is asking for 57 cents per subscriber per year on all streaming platforms uh and look the they also reference this as the same failed strategy as the writer strike where would this money go uh to the union directly I'm guessing I don't know but what okay this isn't for the actors this is for the Union what is the union going to spend it on politicians are they are they going to use it on insurance health insurance on retirement funds the point is I'm just I'm just shocked at the idea that you're in a job where you get a flat fee to do a job right what makes entertainment so different especially on a streaming platform where this isn't Network television where your stuff is being replayed with ads over it this is gay but I think the reason they think it's different when they're working in entertainment rather than a a normal job is because their heart is in it you know that's like oh I put so much of my heart into these projects I deserve more than someone who is fixing a toilet like that's what I think they they thought process actually is I think that the unions right now are focused on external wins meaning like the articles that say they got what they wanted from these from these deals but the studios want the quiet wins which is they get to cancel all the projects that they don't want to do anymore they get to Belt Titan the way they even mentioned in this other article it says like what is the world what does Hollywood look like Post strike they admit in this article streaming is not a profitable business model there are only two streaming services that operate at a profit that is Netflix and Hulu those are the only on it didn't mention Hulu but it said that um things like Disney Plus or Paramount Plus or peacock all of these all lose money they all lose money they all have theoretically plans to make money eventually like they're all saying oh we'll break even by the end of 2024 it never seems to work out and Netflix reported a $6.5 billion profit last year seems like Netflix like what did what did they invest in what did they put into it is what I want to know how much money is put into it every year and most of that Revenue comes from the same shows and comedy specials not from people re-watching suits and rewatching psych and uh Seinfeld and friends that that's why every time the office go license deal ends it becomes a Mad Dash to see who's going to be the next streaming service to finally get the office on there because it's actually drawing eyeballs to the platform the the other thing is like look they the the unions used the stri to tighten budgets and to get rid of um all of these like First Look deals that they didn't want to go forward with anyway and they want to move towards an industry that is uh no longer success divorced from compensation meaning like uh what they were doing before was like large upfront payouts and costs on shows with no return on investment now they want to put medium siiz budgets and reward you if the show actually does well but what's going to end up happening is like so like if they want Merit based the media when they want a show to succeed they'll just manufacture Buzz for a show like they always do yep right they will just start writing a thousand articles about the show that nobody's watching where there's no honest Buzz about it and they're going to have to find a way around that because when when there's Buzz for a show now it's not connected to the media it's connected to social media the reason why dmer was as was as great as it was had nothing to do with the fact that uh that they were writing articles about it it turned into memes or the success of Wednesday exactly it it wasn't necessarily because it was like a great show I enjoyed it it was fine but it was because people made Tik Tok dances it turned into a social media frenzy exactly and the other thing is like when in the other article these streaming services which right now have to have to like button up their tie and lie to investors it's like streaming the quote was streaming profitability will come led by advertisers and getting value propositions right so just cable again right cable yeah well what they're planning to do is raise the prices of ad free tiers and now and AD tiers Netflix is raising the ad tier but just make everyone Retreat to the ad tiers yeah so that they can make Advertiser money and they talk about how Peak uh in 2017 the head of FX talked about how Peak television is done I still maintain that television peaked in 2012 or 2013 when the really really good shows were spread among five to six several networks including cable and the head of FX basically says look there's at this time there was 400 and something shows on the on the air that's not tenable you can't do that forever there aren't enough people to be like there's just not enough interest in all of this stuff for everybody to watch to develop large audiences for all of these shows that number is now ballooned to almost 600 that's insane like people don't have that much time and a lot of people they're whether you like it or not they're like look I don't know what to watch oh look at that Meme about Jenna Ortega I'm going to go watch the the results is actually a good thing which means they're going to stop taking risks on shitty shows and that's going to end up then there was this other article where they talk about how what that's going to do is it's going to hurt the the diversity equity and inclusion crowd because they're going to go back to Merit based policies this is from an article from Yahoo that says Hollywood uh minority writers uh fear diversity downfall and it says employment figures for the industry backup claims that Minority writers are underrepresented the share of black indigenous and people of color in the screen employment was 22.6% in 2020 while the groups accounted for make up 42% of the of the United States population white people held 77.4% of the jobs represented 57.8% of the population according to the report disabled people hold 1% of writing roles for television series Pilots screenplays yet 27% of America uh reports a disability I just get really warm fuzzy feelings when I watch a show and I know that 20% of the writers on the show were disabled that really makes me feel good about myself is it just me or is this is this stuff actually starting to reach the point or or I feel like it's reached the point where it's it's just mockable so much that people just I can't take any of it seriously it's just it's so ridiculous I tweeted about this yesterday I was like look these companies are supposedly profit-seeking entities worth billions of dollars when you go out to buy a car or when you go to pick what doctor to take your kids to you don't ask what percentage of the doctors are disabled the craziest part of that just on its face is I thought you know the majority of people who are disabled in this country are already retired anyway I bet you they're counting like ADHD in this and is ADHD like according to the government a disability I don't know if they're talking physical disability only or if they're talking about what percentage of the American population what percentage of people with mental illnesses are writing scripts these days too many why would you want someone with ADHD writing a script they're not going to be productive enough uh selfishly I want this strike to go another 6 days so that it ends up being longer than the uh 1980 strike but I want it to end primarily because I want actors to start doing promo interviews for their projects again so we can talk about the stupid things that they say yeah we are kind of in like a dry spell right now yeah they also talk about in the other article about how like one of the big things that's going to go bye-bye is movies for people over the age of 35 so the the the the movies you're going to get are going to be even more dumbed down I think that that so Tim talks about this on IRL a lot in the future you're going to be able to just tell AI make this for me and it will go ahead and create it like make this this movie I want to watch a movie about blah blah blah and as J dies off yeah or as as Millennials die off and and the genen Z the one that were raised on Coco melon and then and went to Mr Beast in YouTube rather than actually ever living really through a terrestrial TV I have no idea what you say that's what this says it's young people are on YouTube and Tik Tok people in the middle like Millennials Gen X they're watching streaming services and the older people are quickly dying off and watching cable it's going to die soon so if you I don't feel like and maybe I'm just a little more technically savvy than most of the people my age but I don't feel like the age of the person is going to make a difference once people realize oh you can just type in hey make me this and it'll make it for you I no I think it I think it speaks to their interest because my generation grew up at a time where there were still movie Stars my time grew up at a time where like you actually like there like when we went to see Oppenheimer there are the term Nolan bro is is sounds like a joke but it's a thing there are people who they go there to see his art not to see some type of script that might be a faximile of what he might create so I'm just saying as our M because Tom Cruz is in it but it it won't I don't think I mean maybe there will be people that are that are still you know people that are older that are still interested in actors and stuff but I I don't know that that I mean why wouldn't you just say make a movie with blah blah blah you know with the actor that I want because the because AI is not going to be limited to to just oh it it is likely that AI is not going to be limited by things like oh you can't have this person in or you can't have Etc and it'll if it's if it is if Tim's right and and I think that he's probably on to something if it's true that you're going to be able to have ai generated what what's the point of waiting for it I'm saying it'll be at the behest of like the I I do think the age makes a difference here like like for me for me knowing that that actor didn't like choose to do that role would actually color how I take it the idea of giving an AI a prompt to make a movie for me is like I would never want to do that there are already people that do music and that's what I was going to get into I said like I feel like it's a little bit uh the same as music that may maybe you're right that like the people be but that to me that's a novelty like to me it's a novelty to hear a song that I already know that wasn't created by a I mean I understand it sounds I mean you're essentially you're making a supply side argument right like people don't know what they want until you show them yeah so people people would say so like the the supply side economics argument is is when you have a an economy that can create Innovations and and things that's when people are like oo that I want you didn't know you wanted an iPhone until the iPhone was created so people won't know that they like or they won't know that that they they can get this thing un or they that they have the option unless it's put in front of them you know what I mean I feel like it would end up becoming a sub genre rather than the rather than the rule because I feel like for uh oh I lost my point what was I I had such a great point to make too it was so great but I do I feel like it'll end up becoming a a sub genre that certain people like cuz Okay no so so what it is think about when people go on Netflix and they spend an hour scrolling they don't choose anything they like there's the people who say like I wait to make my food until I decide what I want to watch cuz otherwise I'll make my food and it'll be cold by the time I actually you wait for this the screen to just like that that's an active process in your brain to make those decisions that I think people don't want to make people get Frozen because they they have too many options that happens you you don't know what you want or you see multiple things and you can't make a decision if you give people if you give people like two or three options they can make a decision when you give them 50 options they're like uh am I supposed to do with this don't Netflix still makes money off of you even if you sit there scrolling all night like like if if I'm if somebody's like okay we got this movie and it's you can have it star Tom Cruz Denzel Washington Bruce Willis uh uh and they listen 10 actors I'm going to spend an hour trying to think of which of those 10 actors I want to fit in there and then I'm going to have to think which one of the 10 actors who's going to play his his uh antagonist to Myan after there by the time I've made that decision I'm ready for bed for all those I don't find that idea appealing I I feel like that like that's it's like maybe Generations maybe Generations down the line as how we actually consume content changes I I think that uh you guys are going to be surprised at how fast people uh people uh glob on stuff like that because and I think the the cell phone was something that really kind of made me believe that because the the pocket computer essentially there's only a handful of people that I know that once they saw what a cell phone could do were like no I don't want it I think I know three people that don't have a a modern-day smartphone that they're like I want my flip phone or I have this kind of thing and they're all over 60 you know and and and then everybody else even people that are over 60 or whatever they they still are on Facebook they have their iPhone or smartphone or whatever so I think that that once people see how the function goes and just as long as it's not super complex I think that it's something that people would do a lot it also what what what that does to me and like this is this is a personal preference here there's something really depressing about that because one of the things I love about movies in television is when you see a movie with an actor that you didn't necessarily know about and they give this great performance or a actor you do know about who you don't think would be good in that role because that maybe it's not the genre it's like when Jim Carrey started doing stuff that wasn't purely comedy right like I want to be surprised by the performance from somebody who I didn't imagine in that role but I'm actually limiting it to like oh I can imagine that this actor could do this so I'm only going to be given what I have the what I believe is possible or entertaining to see rather than what somebody else came up with the idea of and then ends up surprising me like that to me is more joyous than the idea that I can just pick the best actor that I've ever seen for each of these it's like to me it's akin to playing with dolls or playing with your your action figures and like I don't see the cinema experience the same way but you're absolutely right that as technology evolves and as our relationship with technology evolves that that could become more common place but I personally hope that that's not what happens I don't I don't want that to be where entertainment goes so all right let's go to let's go to super chats we we kind of went off in a tangent there yeah quite blackp said I only watch for the chairs well yes we' we've got one right there actually want to have the the fourth chair join us for a Super Chat he's he was right there we could we could put the fourth chair on right now he's he's right there Hi hi chair John Stewart said I for one welcome our future Catholic dict is that the female that would be you is that the female for dictator dictor I don't know I have no idea dictator jpot said if evil exists that proves the existence of God is that true Mary what was that he said if evil exists that proves the existence of God a lot of people uh believe the opposite they say if evil exists that that disproves that God exists um what do you say Phil uh I don't think that uh the existence of God or I don't think evil the existence of evil is indicative of an existence of God I think if he were to elaborate he'd say if you can uh distinguish between objective moral evil and moral good then there has to be a source for that truth but let's not get into any theological debates on this show ever since said 35k is all the teacher made asman gold talked to him to the to the I'm guessing it means to the guy don't know the the one who we talked about earlier AZ o said we did that one oh okay Shane H Wilder said the attitude Awards feels like a cult meeting with Dylan as their own Jim Jones guys could we get um let's get the likes up over 300 on this video we got 731 are you are Jim Jones that is me I'm I'm I'm not charismatic enough I I would never be trust me I I would love to have that level of Charisma but unfortunately I don't I would only use it for good though of course I would never use it for evil John Stewart said I nominate Mary for cast Castle woman of the year I I think that would have to go to Brian yes yeah he's the rightful yeah winner um perturbed alpaca said Brett bring up Taco Bell knowing full well the chili cheese burrito is not available Nationwide one of you go eat two for me look I I I the funny thing is here's the thing when you when you do a show like this every day the stories that come to your mind that have informed your life will repeat and I I actually left that story off the Taco Bell discussion because I didn't want to repeat myself for the hundredth time I figured it'll come up again at some point someone is going to remind you somebody will remind me that yes uh I do still laugh at my friends in Florida because they don't have uh they don't have that they don't have those chili cheese burritos ESO said reminder to buy casar coffee this post was not paid for by Tim pool hi Phil hope your day is well thank you there you go let's hold off on the rest and we'll come back after we finish up Mary tell us what's going on with this influencer there is an influencer named Linda Andrade who is based in Dubai and her content is essentially uh her Dubai housewife Journey she is married to a millionaire and brags about all of the luxury items that he purchases for her I love that it's a journey it's like when women now say everything's an era yeah oh thank you there we go yeah she's in her Dubai housewife era they have to now I want to push back on the belief that this woman is a gold digger you think she loves it her content is made to rile people up it's made to get reactions and she's she's flexing on people but she is not a gold digger there used to do you guys remember like well you probably don't remember but there used to be a show called Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous that people would watch and they didn't hate the people that were rich like you didn't watch it so that way you could hate on it and it is it's just such a to me it's really really bad that people watch other people and and are specifically just angry and envious like they just allow the most horrible horrible emotions to take control of them because they don't have it and it is absolutely disgusting we saw that D the sub during this when the sub incident happened the Ocean Gate yeah people were giddy at the idea of rich people dying in a horrible way and I I I'm not sure what has happened in society to make people like that but it's really sickening it's really gross well my my pet theory is that Flex culture on social media for influencers reached its peak in the Trump Administration in the late 2010s because the economy wasn't quite so bad as it is today in in biomics and uh we were in the prepandemic world and now um people are dealing with a recession that resulted from printing trillions of dollars and we're feeling the the pain from that so when you see influencers flexing their money on you you're going to feel that tinge of resentment and that that feeling of not have maybe and uh influencers didn't used to get so much flak for flexing their wealth as they do today like it was a trend actually it it was popular yeah there were you know I mean Jeffree Star posting pictures of himself with his 17 McLaren I mean it's supposed to be inspirational right like aspirational you want to you want to get there supposed to be like Oh I'm hoping that I can because the the one of the things that that was considered the American dream right was to be able to to Aspire to to better yourself and stuff and it used to be that like everyone in the The Narrative was everyone in America that is not a millionaire is just currently is a millionaire they're just currently embarrassed you know it's like something's happened and they they will be a millionaire soon or whatever but like right now there's a there's a problem that they're just dealing with and once that gets taken care of then they'll go on and and whereas that's not realistic for everyone it is a good attitude to have because it's essentially having a white pill for look white pilled outlook on your life it's hey maybe things are bad right now but they're going to be better and I believe that they're going to get better and that makes people that that is I think that that actually is connected to why the the there's so much depression and suicide is is up is because people are not aspirational the way they used to be and I don't know exactly what how it is to fix that but still I see so much content so much Doomer content that's designed to it's it's one of the things me and me and Lydia would go back and forth about how she would talk a lot about like the housing crisis and everything going on and I would tell her I'm like look this isn't going to turn people into capitalists it's going to turn people into Communists and socialists because they're being told there's no way out of this problem other than the government and there's propaganda and Doomer propaganda all over the place especially on social media because it's a flex to say like look how much easier your parents now it's like how can I dump my trauma into this funny video about how I'm not going to get ahead in life there's also the the uh um there's also the fact that people want to be able to uh to hate on other people and feel Justified I forget who said it but there's no the there was a quote that's like there's there's no psychological treat that's better than being able to hate someone else and be morally justified in it for I wish that I had the quote right in front of me but essentially it boils down to if you can cause harm to someone else and this goes to why cancel culture is a thing and stuff as well if you can cause harm to someone else or or put put someone else in a position you know put yourself in a someone else put yourself above someone else in a Justified way in a way that feels like it's Justified and you're in the right then it's then it's a it's one of the the most luscious psychological treats and I think that did you see that with uh with like not to get into the the situation but like with the Palestine Israeli thing like Israel is the powerful one so people are are drawn to support Palestine or Palestinians because they're in the underdog position they're not you know they're the weak power so it's like oh if you support the the powerful then you're doing a moral wrong if you support the not powerful then you're doing a moral right even if they're not powerful literally just like killed a bunch of killed a bunch of innocent people I think a lot of it is also that there has been a bit of a veil pulled back on the American dream look the middle class has shrunk extensively in this country espe like think about like a lot of it also might be like born out of like how the financial crisis in 2008 watched all the bankers get bailed out and people are like look if they can't fail uh like what hope is that for the rest of us if like that was like that might have been a really big black pill for a lot of people in a lot of respects which might be why content like this especially at times when gas prices are super high uh is very hard for people to watch also to be fair we'll show at least one of these videos she does it in a way that's designed to be learn to code and then move to Dubai where you don't have to pay taxes why don't she just marry a rich it's like if you're poor buy a house if if you don't have a house buy a house so some of the comments this is not a flex this is a waste rich people can't read the room another said I cry when I spend $10 at mad at me because I said like look when The Rock and Oprah Winfrey asked for people to donate money I said I was like well how much do you want them to donate and they're not asking you if you're poor they're saying if you have the money yeah to to donate but just the just the image just the suggestion to people upsets them they say read the room I said so should they should just not say anything read what room they're making a video like just they don't everything that you see on the internet is not for you like it doesn't it just it is on your for you page that's bad that's so here's um here's one of these videos way to what I expect from my millionaire husband when I get pregnant part four I gotta I I don't know if that we're gonna have to I don't want to have like 9,000 different [Applause] music so it says pink Kelly for girl blue Birkin bag Spa every single day gender reveal gold in the weight of the baby this is her uh she she talks about her husband as her Mexican Habibi neither of them are from Dubai um they met in California okay all of her videos are like this uh one says it's officially been one year since I started my Dubai housewife Journey here on Tik Tok another says reasons I love being a Millionaire's wife uh things I asked for when I got married uh it's such it's it's like a weir how much my millionaire husband spent on me this week it's like a weird Rich persons version of like well it would be boring if I made one of those what I eat in a day videos but like what I spend in a day is actually interesting uh when he fixes fights by taking out his credit card like all of these are are meant to be upsetting not upsetting shocking it's it's reactionary like people feel a certain type of way about it but you feel she's not a gold digger the way that they they met she was not being a gold digger this says it's been such a long journey and Ricky knows the truth Ricky here her husband Linda reportedly met him at a gym when she was 16 whereupon uh she gave him her number because his cell phone was broken and she suggested her father could fix it at his electronics repair shop this guy was a dishwasher technician at the time he hadn't made any of his money so he became a day trader and an entrepreneur after they started dating and she credits her dad's strong work ethic with helping her determine which traits she desired in a partner when I met Ricky I saw all those similar traits to my father and him I wasn't looking for a wealthy guy I was looking for ambition and above all a good man money is not the end all Beall because you could be with someone who rich and treats you like crap you know she's like but so the real important thing is to be with a rich guy who doesn't treat you like crap is what she say she she comes from a family that with humble beginnings she says that they shared a one-bedroom apartment in a family of six I wonder if she's got her own story where she's like she's like talking to the camera and he comes out and she's like my parents drove me to school and he's like do be honest the truth what did you drive what did you what did your dad drive you to school in okay so he drove me to school in a Maserati so what like look it's it's we were working class these videos are designed to get a rise out of people for the sake of of social media Cloud I mean just taking a look at her videos before you have any context will tell you she's nvo reach like she's flexing her her Birkin bags and her Chanel bags and designer cars and designer diamonds and all of this stuff like maybe she'll call somebody a broky like Andrew Tate she actually does she like made a video like should you marry a broi or a rich man uh you know it's uh I wonder if she does she do the dishes Mary think she does the dishes now that she's a kept woman well no she she jokes that she hires housekeepers to do all the cleaning for her because that's what her husband asks of her unbelievable yeah it's kind of it's kind of hilarious it's just but the worst part about their lifestyle is the fact that they live in Dubai that sounds awful that there have been a lot of influencers paid to promote traveling to Dubai moving to Dubai Dubai and it's very suspicious to me Dubai has no income tax Dubai has no property tax sure there arees but why do you need to pay influencers to convince people to go there in videos where it looks like they're in a ghost town in the middle of the desert because of the beheadings because people in the Middle East get their heads chopped off and and it's got bad P they want they want westerners to move to Dubai yeah that's the point yeah and the reason why their streets are clean and why so safe for women there is because they have a no tolerance policy on any type of petty crime let alone violent crime they'll literally just execute you yes which is cool but I don't want to live in the middle of a desert that they poured concrete over I don't know the um the the idea that she oh also like you'll see influencers there who are flown out to do all sorts of degenerate things yes you know thankfully she didn't have that happen to her yeah it the the part about her like like paying for somebody to clean cuz he's paying for somebody he's he's hiring somebody to clean she's just making she's the one that swipes the credit card you know she can get me of I don't remember what show it was but it was some some show where like a husband and wife are talking about how like she's talking about she wants to get her husband something meaningful for his for his birthday instead of just buying him something with his credit card that he's going to may or may not like a V you know a varying levels of importance and uh like I wonder if she's able to like do stuff like that for him hopefully she can but uh you know he's got to be okay with being married to a woman who wants to make their lives public like that which you know a lot of people might not be yeah that's the surprising part is that she's more famous than him and he's supposed to be the celebrity entrepreneur he has to explain to his colleagues why his wife is going viral on Tik Tok using his money for Chanel bags and diamond rings all right let's go Super Chat here yoshima otaru said that just seemed like the same awkward stick yeah yeah it didn't look super she might have looked a little bit less standoffish well the reason she broke character when she was talking to Dave pornoy is because she was the one getting interviewed it's only when she's recording her own interviews that she does the the shtick yeah it's a character bad Adam 12 said for the love of God stop going to Taco Bell I will gladly buy you all real tacos at Taco Bar and Frederick after your show one day Phil can even come along GH Taco Bell is good I don't care what you say taco bar sounds good too did did you add the he add okay he said be like I I didn't realize that uh was going on there Mary no John Stewart said you're not just some dude Phil you're the best failed metal artist I am I'm the best failed metal artist bill of the people said have you watched the trailer for Thanksgiving no left leftovers your thoughts I have not yet I did just see the trailer for the um the uh the claw the Eric Van the vonic movie um looks it's a24 so it's already pretentious but looks all right King New Jersey said what okay Dylan Mulaney named woman of the year really WTF is wrong in the USA technically this wasn't in the USA yeah I was in the UK as you guys know that I have uh I don't know if I want to say that CTIC uh wait what fibrosis cystic fibrosis no that's not no um if I dressed like a woman I would have another problem thank God I just make money you guys should let on the show I have no idea what any of that means sorry like that was a little bit hard to read man um King New Jersey said good I can call Dylan Mulaney beep and beep no you can't Shane H Wilder said I don't see it as having too many options I see it as having too many crappy options which is why I tried why tried and true shows get the most streams yeah but you don't know they're crappy until you watch to to try right well you can you can make a general assumption but like if you're like if you're creating like you know would be the worst imagine creating your own movie with AI and it sucks yeah you got nobody to blame but yourself King New Jersey said yes Mary the physically disabled physically disabled people do not have a job because you don't understand about outside BS World treats me on the job I own my company but most disabled people disabled people are like want I have I have no idea what your super chats mean um sir um then he said yes Mary I'm 0.1% of the 0 1% of disabled persons I watch you guys for my 2-hour break then work until 9:00 p.m. to 6: a.m. to 10:00 p.m. if you own your own company man good on you and that's that's really really good my my point that I was making in that segment was that look uh with a doctor or the people who create the cars you drive you're not you're not looking to find the people that you want to hire based on equity and the same should hold true for any profit seeking entity that's worth billions of dollars that's just my person opinion that if you're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to create something that's supposed to then profit you Millions upon millions of dollars you should be looking for the best overall candidate for the job not that Hollywood studios are looking at the resumés of disabled people and chucking them in the shredder like that's not happening John Stewart said I went to Dubai when I was in the Navy they're diversifying away from oil to tourism well Instagram must help them with that a lot um Shane H Wilder said she's married to the man's money not the man I mean I I thought your story made it like seem like she was in it for the long like yeah they've been together for eight years and liking the like liking what's come of it does not necessarily mean you didn't love him beforehand yeah the fact that that he had nothing in the beginning like she met him when when he was poor would make me believe that she actually gave a crap about him but she wants people on social media to think that she's a gold digger so that she gets more comments I mean maybe but I mean she's just looking for attention probably she's bored I do love the idea that if it was a movie and he was a dishwasher technician everybody would introduce him as a dishwasher and he be like I'm a dishwasher technician not a dishwasher they're different things it would be a skit all right guys before we go would you hit the like button on this video would you subscribe to

Julia Fox is yet another female celebrity promoting her new Memoir it's called down the drain I guess that's where Kanye's urine went right down no it went it went into the to the onto the wall so in this Memoir she details the Romantic encounter in which they first met and it has a pee incident okay I'm sorry but I need to tell you this is the first night they met she calls him the artist by the way she doesn't name him in the Memoir she's just you know gesturing toward who it might be the artist starts peeing on the wall and I quickly jump in front of him before telling people outside the club not to take any pictures this is her Valiant moment where she's literally the Secret Service of Pee She Shields him from the paparazzi getting getting the pee photos she jumps in front of a man who's peeing well the funniest part in front of in front of him like he's in a dark alley she's covering the alley so that no one can see him it's actually really romantic if you think about it no then he gets done he's like I wanted them to take that photo I was trying to make it controversial what are you doing and then it says once he Zips his pants back up he puts his arms around me and pulls me in close kissing me passionately bro didn't even wash his hands first that was like all the comments uh on the videos I start talking about this were debating about like the why did people feel so strongly about this specific account no idea they were veryable he peed in it out that's like the worst thing ever and it's just like bro like if if you're a dude who's gotten drunk at a bar it's likely I'm not like grossed out by him I'm grossed out by her that she wasn't grossed out by it that she's acting like this is like a huge romantic moment between her and a lover it's like you're a gold digger who tried to like get on yeah get he put his hands on her face and Whitney and Whitney Houston's I will always love you just played from inside the inside the bar right at that Crescendo moment I think she you're kind of right that she's a bit of a goal Digger but it's more an opportunity Digger cuz she was saying in this Memoir she wasn't really that into Kanye she was into the opportunities that he might be able to give her if she stays with him despite not really liking him that much um and I think she is doing what his current wife Bianca sorri might do eventually which is turning on him and making him the villain in the story of their relationship she says now that she was simply being used as a pawn in his Grandmaster plan to get back at his ex-wife that's humiliating that's a really shitty position to be in and she also called Kanye a master gaslighter uh essentially accusing him of being abusive without actually saying that M which just seems uh misleading and opportunistic yeah she's like playing the victim card now cuz she's lost opportunities for having dated Kanye at this point since his reputation has gone downhill she's now she's associated with him she's kind of canceled by association and she has to distance herself do you remember this article from 20202 that says Julia fox said she dated Kanye West to get him off Kim Kardashian's case and distract him that's what she said I thought ultimately I'd be helping a precarious situation oh shut up but I learned very quickly that I was being weaponized I felt like his little puppet I feel like he's using me in some weird Twisted game and it makes me feel dirty it's funny cuz she admits to using him yeah they used each other they used each other right exactly so who's the victim nobody no no the by by the modern day Progressive law of power dynamics she's a woman so she's dumb and stupid that's that's literally what they're saying they're like she he's got he's got M more Fame and more wealth than her and she's a woman so she's dumb that's that's literally what they're saying she can't handle his master gaslighting so like it's always funny whenever like people kind of horseshoe around to like uh we we want to help women so much that we're going to pretend like they're invalids which is what they're saying they don't know any better that's what they're saying about Bianca Sor right now the more accurate representation and the more the more empowering situation would say they know exactly what they're doing and even if you disagree with having a transactional relationship with a person as a fully grown big girl adult she's allowed to do that and get whatever she wants out of that relationship because sometimes life isn't as simple is falling in love like a Disney movie especially if you're a disgusting celebrity who's just out to turn every interaction with another human being in your favor y yeah it's it's an insult to women to treat them like children I think that what Bianca sinor is doing with her life right now um is degrading but I think she's doing it on Purp purpose and she doesn't need anyone to save her she's going to learn the consequences of her own actions the way any adult should MH um she also Julia Fox revealed that Kanye offered to get her a boob job while playing Uno about like two weeks into knowing each other we were spending a day playing Uno in a game that involves highlighting positive words in the dictionary what is this kindergarten I'll get you and sine came up Kanye offered a yeah Kanye had given her a a top that she said it doesn't look good unless she wears a bra and then he said I'll get you a boob job if you want ah the romance she said no thanks uh and then she said she said it made her uncomfortable okay that's a bit of a loaded word um he was just offering but um I don't know he was just being a nice guy I would a little offended but I don't know he thinks every chick wants a boob job proba somebody thought it was interesting given that his mom died of plastic surgery oh yeah he was trying to kill her is that what that's not what they said but yeah they said it was interesting they like thought you thought he would be more sensitive to the issue given that his mom died undergoing cosmetic surer he seems to never learn from his mistakes right because it's like they what we love about him yeah like I mean it's almost like a innocence kind of thing in a way but which I actually I don't think it is at all but it's like he keeps dating these women and then acting shocked that they only like him for his resources Fame and money and doesn't understand why they keep like leaving him and betraying him and WR these hit pieces or Memoirs actually you know whatever you call them now so I I don't feel bad for him or her I think he almost certainly was using this public relationship to do what he thinks is getting back at Kim Kardashian when in reality he was just making himself look worse and making her look like the bigger person she just turned into Super Dad and just become dad of the year who just did like everything for the kids all the time and just make her look like a a greedy work work obsessed like that would have worked narcissis it would have worked for him yeah but I I guess their breakup amounted to um Kanye soft ghosting Julia Fox because he got on a phone call with Kim Kardashian where he learned he was so shocked to learn that Julia Fox had had addiction issues in the past and he's like well that's just a bridge too far and Julia said uh I already told you that I had been on drugs before you just weren't listening she she does mention a thing there's even like funny he doesn't vet these women at all yeah so well they're talking and he just he's just bring he's like yeah yeah you're you know you're really smart people underestimate you there was the thing where she said like when when he called like he would mostly talk and I would mostly listen and I laugh cuz it's like of course right he's the Mad genius uh and you're the and you're the the new woman in his life and but she said but when he when I did talk he said yeah all of my points were very interesting and I was very intelligent so he he sprinkled on the compliments as much as he could muster he's like wait like he he probably pays a guy to like stand like awkwardly in the Next Room and listen to what he said what she said and then like write a synopsis that he can read later right it's like she thinks he was she was his Muse but really it was just him thinking about himself the entire time literally any woman should just sat there she is most known for that clip of her being like I was Josh saf's M in on Cut jams on Cut Js I just um she also says her Memoir didn't detail intimate moments with Kanye because their bond was essentially sexless quote it wasn't really about that she she claims that they never had sex interesting honestly I I would believe that I would believe that yeah cuz if it is advantageous to claim that you did you know she would MH right doesn't really make a difference at that point she was waiting for that so she could add the part in the Memoir about how he was sexually aggressive but she can't because they didn't have sex yeah exactly also by the time that they stopped talking Kanye sent her at NDA and said if you don't sign this NDA we can't be friends anymore and she said I'll live boundaries he's got boundaries he also sent ndas to her friends it is kind of obnoxious that she kind of expected him to hire her friends as an Entourage of stylists like he told her that one of the things that bothers him about her is that she constantly brings her friends to everything they do have you ever seen that like Tik Tok where the girl shows up to like a date with a guy with like a friend and then and then gets mad when the guy like leaves he's like I'm not kind of like that yeah yeah but he did end up you know employing her friends I'm sorry but it's really funny he put her friends on the payroll it's really funny that if millionaire Kanye West like they come to dinner and he makes like he just splits the check he like he makes like he's like I'll pay for you but I'm not paying for your friends there was that other video where like a guy uh took his girlfriend out for for dinner over uh like for her birthday and she brought like all her friends and family and he's like I'm not paying for all of these people didn't she get mad about that yeah she got really mad about that the girl will be like whatever happened to chivalry yeah no really that's literally what would happen you invite the neighbors like your dog walker the mailman everything you know it's it's a scam it's a scam kind of tired of self-interested professional adult women getting into relationships that are essentially transactional and then acting like they're victims after the facts exactly if you want to be in a transactional relationship that's fine but just be honest about the fact that's what you want she didn't get the prize that she wanted at the end because of the fact that Kanye blew up his reputation after the fact she didn't get the cred the street cred in her industry that she thought she would get so when she realized she took the wrong Gamble she wants to turn it around and make it out like he was the bad guy she's like now I have to start this stupid podcast to talk to these stupid celebrities she putting out a mem she's she has the podcast she's doing also a reality show that's kind of like Project Runway she's kind of perfect for that to be honest like in the 2000s this is exactly the type of person who would have ended up on a reality show with a reality show she's she's perfect for that that's like right on his reputation didn't hurt her at all in my opinion yeah she's still able to get away like Scots free and play the victim card and is still getting all these opportunities how do you guys do you guys feel that he's um controlling his uh his new wife oh probably most likely they are legally married now yeah we were wrong about that they are legally married they are they're not married they are they're legally married at this point yeah I don't know for me personally no amount of money would be worth that but uh it's not if every not even if he puts all your friends and family on the payroll I mean she was already on the payroll before they were even dating she was an employee of his family right now was like come on Sarah I don't know what it means that she was his architect for for Yeezy but yeah that's how they met kind of like how Elon meets his baby mamas he's got well those work those workplace things it's just it's it's can be can be dangerous if you're if you're Elon but elon's also such a Droid that it's like it doesn't even matter like there's not really much emotional it doesn't feel like like I I wonder what emotions like do does Does Elon Musk have emotional emot fraught conversations with Grimes or does he just she's like I'm mad at you he's like what are you mad about well there was that time that Elon posted a tweet saying like pronouns are stupid or something and then Grimes replied I know this isn't your heart call me oh my god oh by the way I have a new i' I've added another phrase to my list of things that don't mean anything and I think more than any more than any phrase out of all of them my heart is so full makes me angrier than anything it's like I get it you're at a wedding I really do hate that now that you mention it I didn't even realize that that was the phrase that like triggers me but yeah my heart is so wasn't there another one that like triggered you nourishing my body I hate nourishing I hate I hate the word nourishing in general but yeah nourishing my body is I have a list it's I unfortunately like oh yeah stepping into my comments that's what I hate stepping into my comments I hate that one it's for a lot of it is like a bunch of a bunch of these got deleted off my off my list of anything involving my truth taking back my happiness be kind I know you don't like be kind that's because it's a morphous it doesn't mean anything it's like uh it's like nobody's meaner than a person who has be kind in their profile they are the meanest people on on Earth you see it on school like there's like a there's a school out here that just has it like on the fence of the of the baseball stadium I also really don't like be yourself that was the ubiquitous phrase for children of the 2000s be yourself I don't even know what that means taking back my happiness what I'm re reclaiming reclaiming my happiness yeah you took a creative writing class great I hate congrats I hate all of that it's just it's like say like I'm happy now that's way easier it's just get off Instagram those are all Instagram phrases right literally if you if you made an it's like I'm going to make an inspirational infographic app and it just has like word like phrase suggestions now I need to like air my grievances about this new season of Love is Blind because you can really easily tell that all of the women on the show are normies who don't think any deeper than Instagram quotes about self-love like every I forgot about okay especially the woman from Puerto Rico that Dane claims he used to know she's one of the worst first and she's like I'm perfect I'm I'm so emotionally mature and I have it all together and I just need to find someone who deserves me like this is the language of the dating world right now also all of the women show up like thoughts that are like going out to a night in the club and the men are dressed up for like job interviews like it doesn't make sense men should just start turning the tables and doing that where they just show up with like barbecue sauce shirt like half the shirt is tucked in half the shirt isn't I need a woman who can handle all of this no these men are dressing up for dates where the women can't see them I mean granted they're on TV so a lot of people are going to see them but still yeah most of the women were just like touting self-love phrases like I'm ready to date because I finally have accepted myself and learned to love myself and I've been in I've been in bad had relationships before because I didn't love myself and all of the men were evil toxic narcissists you were never the it's like it is Taylor Swift syndrome if you've dated 33 guys and they will sabotage their own relationships and then blame the guy or self-pity about it afterwards like this one girl was on the verge of getting proposed to by this guy and decided to finally drop this bomb of information on him that she has been divorced like on one of their like they're pretty far along in the process and then she's like by the way I got divorced is that okay with you and he's like uh no and then she goes to throw a pity party about it like he doesn't accept me for me well there isn't really a thing that a woman could a woman could literally be like look I went to jail for murder in the 80s and and then and then she she like that's okay right and the guy would be like no that's not okay I don't date women who have been uh who have been uh you know in prison for murder I guess just insecure thanks for watching listen to full

Julia Fox is promoting her new Memoir it's called down the drain I guess that's where Kanye's urine went she details the Romantic encounter in which they first met the artist starts peeing on the wall and I quickly jump in front of him before telling people outside the club not to take any pictures Shields him from the paparazzi it's actually really romantic if you think about it she says now that she was simply being used as a pawn in his Grand master plan to get back at his ex-wife I also called Kanye a master gaslighter I felt like his little puppet he's using me in some weird Twisted game and it makes me feel dirty he seems to never learn from his mistakes right he keeps dating these women and then acting shocked that they only like him for his resources Fame and money and doesn't understand why they keep leaving him and betraying him and writing these hit pieces or Memoirs I don't feel bad for him or her,ZECbHiZOvUo
about what's going on over at Warner Brothers uh and the fact that they could be selling to Universal in the next couple of years which is very very interesting considering they just got sold from AT&T to Discovery like less than a year ago I didn't even know that AT&T owned Warner Brothers before that right so what's what's interesting to me about this is like look they can't win we've watched them release project after project in the last year uh and they can't seem to find a footing for anything that works none of the DC movies have really done all that well they're not really doing anything with Harry Potter outside of the theme parks until the new television show comes around but Universal which is owned by Comcast has had nothing but success stories this year so they did Oppenheimer Fast and the Furious um Super Mario Brothers yes uh as well as cocaine bear in Five Nights at Freddy's is about to come out and we were having trouble finding tickets for Five Nights at Freddy's because all the seats were sold outs know what sells also Puss in Boots The Last Wish uh and what's interesting like like people mention like how how much money Barbie made with all of this press and all of this like media fervor Super Mario Brothers almost beat like they they barely beat Super Mario Brothers and they did it without any of less marketing way way less marketing but also way less buzz from like us talking about it right it just proves the strength of the brand for them uh and so Comcast is is at this time the largest media conglomerate in the United States it's like number one next to I think um I had the list it owns the rest of Hulu that Disney doesn't own exactly right so uh like Comcast AT&T Disney Paramount Global and then Warner Brothers Discovery are the are the companies that are the biggest media conglomerates in in America but Comcast also owns um Universal or I'm sorry they own sci-fi Universal CNBC MSNBC uh and then also the Universal Parks which is like that's a lot of stuff to own so one of the things you have to worry about is like look it's going to end up you're consolidating down so far that only a small number of companies own any of these businesses and why would you want to sell the company why would why would um Warner Brothers want to sell right now when it would be at a loss because they haven't been able to bolster their numbers or cut enough weight from their from their books well in this article it says it's because uh Warner Brothers is broke AF right now so it's a last ditch effort and this is why David zaslav demanded that James gun recast DC with cheaper Talent like David Corn sweat uh as Superman the plan for the original The Flash movie uh was not what we saw they were saying it was going to have a bunch of cameos and set up for movies with Henry caval with Ben Affleck like all all the favorites and then they had to change it last minute and it was not what they envisioned at all and what's funny about like if you look at the biggest companies in the world it's Apple Saudi oil and Microsoft oh my God right so there's also talks like they they assume that there's a lot of people that assume that at some point apple is just this enormous Corporation that's going to eventually buy up one of these companies likely Paramount at some point the Lend like it's very possible they could because they have the money their own streaming service is not doing so hot but the thing is they they're kind of insulated the way Amazon is right the the the market cap on on Apple is $2.7 trillion so it's like they have the the cash Reser you know the Apple TV plus is merely a footnote for them so it doesn't matter that no one watches and and the problem with consolidation is is like uh there there's an article we're going to cover tomorrow that's talking about how the thing that Hollywood really wanted out of this writer strike was to be able to start cutting the the the dead weight from a lot of these companies but what it's going to mean is that a lot less creativity because you're only going to have so many places where you can go to get entertainment and a lot of them are becoming tech companies apple is not a media company it's a tech company Amazon was a a book publishing company turned into a Marketplace and they're becoming some of the largest Distributors of entertainment uh and companies like Comcast when you think about just the size of uh of their operation so if they're running your MSNBC and your CNBC so that's your financial news your shitty mainstream press your shitty movies and actually I shouldn't even say shitty they actually made the good uh plenty of the actual good movies that came out this year imagine they consolidate further the same way that um 20th Century Fox got bought by Disney like at one point you had a chance to just go to all of these different places to get your entertainment the old X-Men movies anybody ever seen any the old X-Men movies back in the day very from the Marvel movies you get now right and I think that's a great way to look at it like back then you got these movies from Brian Singer uh which were vastly different from what Marvel would then go on to make eight years later now all anybody can talk about is how they're going to integrate the X-Men into the already previously established Marvel franchises like do we really want to see what it looks like when we have to have uh Super Mario Brothers vers DC or something like that right like it's it's just not interesting to me uh and it and it stifles creativity uh and oh also they also did um Megan this year I thought that that was a pretty good movie I like that one and that's the same Studio that's making the Five Nights at Freddy's movie exactly really well I like if they're so the idea is like if they're going to have to sell if they if they want to sell Warner Brothers Discovery for an actual like profit they'll have to actually make something that makes money which they haven't than Barbie other than no no that was um that was Universal that made Barbie Warner Brothers didn't make Barbie I'm saying Warner Brothers is going to have to have projects that actually make money if they want to sell at a profit and they haven't really been able to do that in the last year is this the type of thing where like do you guys have like we've had this discussion before about like whether men or women have streaming services do you have any streaming services no not really uh no so like cable but cable was a thing right everyone had cable with a thousand choices uh eventually you're only going to have three or four that you're going to be able to choose from and all of the past stuff that's fine but eventually you're going to start seeing all the entertainment looking the same Brett Barbie is a Warner Brothers that's no that's what I'm saying you said it was Universal I said it no I don't think so it's it's a Super Mario Brothers was a universal Barbie was a I'm saying that Warner Brothers will have to have something other than Barbie that makes money yeah yes uh everything else Warner Brothers released this year was crap and the only reason I remember that is because Oppenheimer was Universal and Warner Brothers was Barbie and all and it Christopher Nolan used to make all his movies through Warner Brothers and then switch to Universal after the Flop that was 10 I mean I've half jokingly said that I'm just so tired of having to look up where to stream blank show or movie cuz there's like they are constantly switching licensing and there's like two seasons of this show on Paramount plus and then the other two are on this other one and like I I'm so tired of searching for where to watch things kind of want a big company to just take over all the streaming services if you guys are looking for the answer to that uh if you go to if you have IMDb you don't even have to have IMDb Pro you can set like what streaming services you have right uh and you can check all and then when you look up a show it lists right under there it says you can find this show at this Co also use alternative streaming platforms disou all at least uh but also like so if if they're restructuring DC right now and we have James gun making all of these changes they sell to Universal in two years and it just gets rebooted again and then they just start over again that's what would end up happening I mean I want them to just stop altogether making DC movies because I don't like them I know I know Valiant uh they said they're saying sell within 2 years I know Valiant rade said it probably wouldn't be doable in less than 3 to five but I just uh I want to see in my lifetime both DC and Marvel Run themselves into the ground very plausible I mean at least the the I want to live to see that may not be soon but I want to see it well the the idea would be more that like it would be that they're just less popular now I don't think it's ever going to be that thing where you're like it is now in officially in the ground everyone who has a Marvel tattoo is going to regret it the um I I also wonder if Apple will end up buying Paramount or something like that but that would that would kind of signal like a a strategic shift in where they're looking to take the business and I think they've done very well with their you know Avant guard shows on their little streaming service that they probably write off as a loss every year sance is really good that's the only thing I remember liking from Apple TV but well everybody always complains that there isn't enough new stuff coming out but Apple TV actually does seem to consistent put out new stuff that's not the same cookie cutter stuff that we see all the time also Paramount or now that I think about it Comcast also has John like the John Wick movies because those are Universal so that franchise and they just released the show the Continental uh and the Twisted Metal Series so they're all making grow they're all growing and expanding but it just seems that Warner Brothers can't seem to do it and you don't even necessarily have to have uh Max to watch Discovery if you want CU you can still watch it on Discovery plus that's so stupid like everything from Discovery plus is on Max yeah but some people just don't have Max yeah so they didn't consolidate them like the less streaming services the better in my opinion it does feel like it's gotten out of uh out of hand lately yeah it's not it's not great but I I got rid of Disney plus I'm not going to watch any of the Marvel shows watch why don't you just bite the bullet and get rid of your all of your streaming services I'm never going to do that why cuz I actually watch cuz I actually watch stuff all I I go through I no cuz then I would okay I'll tell you why I'm not going to do that because we won't have to get into that yeah but uh yeah no no don't encourage Brett to cancel his streaming services that I also May partake I had to okay so here's the thing I exposed Expos I think keep them all s Sarah once very graciously asked if she could watch some stupid baking show that nobody watches um clearly um you know dumb no I'm just kidding what was it called again great hallowen bake off these are probably the only shows that make money now Brett don't denigrate the baking shows and the dating shows like these are the these are the shows that actually bring returns I was just watching the newest the newest season of Love is Blind have you guys seen that yet I love that show I haven't seen the new season but it was very fascinating haven't seen the new season so so s Sarah asks to use my my Max subscription but the here's the problem what when I when I go back to check-in cuz I started watching Deadwood again and it's not the Great British Bake Off that's destroying my my continue watching list it's South Park and um Rick and Morty and I will not have Rick and Morty you just expose Sarah as a Rick and Morty fan you know that is Morty Halloween baking Championship to Rick and Morty pipeline is real okay so I what I did there was CU like I just said like look I don't want my continue watching lists um denig like destroyed with this disgusting different profiles and no so what I did is I made I made a second profile so there's Brett and there's not Brett and I just sent her like a video that just pointed like this me this you I never thought yeah did not send I yeah I sent like a video as like me you as if the one that says not Brett isn't very clearly worded in the thing so just very not in my backyard yes like look you can watch whatever you South Park I'm fine with Rick and Morty not so much but saying like it's like but thing like all my stuff like my there's a a beautiful symmetry to all the things I watch right where it's like it's like uh drama drama drama sure there's some DC animated movies in there but then Rick and Morty what is ruined your perfect algorithm it looked it looked so beautiful before and now now my recommends are changing and it's just I won't have it that's what happens when you're a good person bre yeah thank you I do pay for my own Amazon Prime if you ever need it look at that I've got it Amazon Prime that's fine that's fine also Amazon Prime is is easily the worst of all the streaming services at least as far as user experience oh us yeah yeah I will give you that but they have some good stuff on there they have a lot of a lot of good movies there's there's stuff that I watch on there they just have so much money they don't need to care whether their platform is usable or not like uh Netflix is kind of the same right the Netflix is horrible lately it lags really really bad it just stops play it never stopped pissing me off that they autoplay anything you scroll past on yes I hate that yeah you can turn that off on on one of like either on Amazon or on Netflix you can turn that off netx makes like so much of their own stuff that they don't have any good movies when I try to search a movie I actually know or actually like it never Hulu is where you go for that they just want you to watch their shitty shows and movies thanks for watching listen to full episodes of Pop Culture crisis on Spotify keep up with us on social media and make sure you subscribe and ring that Bell so

"hello YouTube family Auntie is here I'm Patty Jackson I'm your auntie of Pop Culture I know I'm way late but I am here and there is the big hair the curls and the scoop let's start with the hug it's not cute not knowing and now we're going to know and we send prayers to the Isle Brothers family we're going to take some time to remember Rudolph Isley who has died at the age of 84 from an apparent heart attack in his home in Illinois Rudolph Eisley was a founding member of the eely brothers when they formed as the brothers it was in the 50s but the first big hit coming in 1959 shout you know the song you make we want to shout they had uh some big hits during their career in the 60s shout this Old Heart of Mine it's your thing in 1971 the eely brothers expanded they brought in younger brothers Marvin and Ernie with his guitar and they brought in Rudolph's brother-in-law Chris Jasper in 1989 Rudolph Isley left the group to become a Christian minister then he left came back in 1992 The Isley Brother were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by none other than Little Richard this past March the unfortunate story went everywhere Rudolph 84 was suing his brother Ronald Eisley 882 he claimed that even though he wasn't in a group for the past 30 years they still should have given him money from the rec records from the tours because they were using the name The Isley Brothers and as the one of the founding members he felt that some of that money was his they couldn't agree to this you know and make a settlement they were due to go to trial at the first of the year there's always been money craziness Mass entanglements with them when the brother o' Kelly died in the ' 80s 1986 Ron got into a lot of trouble cuz he was still cashing those checks that were coming in for o Kelly and you know Ron had to go to jail for about three years for tax evasion cuz he's just getting money from all over the place and keeping it Rudolph felt you owe me money and it's such a shame because you wish that the brother s could have gotten back to being brothers and not having money get in the way will Rudolph's family pick it up continue the lawsuit will it just go away with Rudolph dying but Rudolph Isley was one of the founding members now when you think of the Eisley brothers obviously you think of Ron Eisley cuz he sang lead on all the songs you know Ernie um he and Ernie is still touring Ernie is still putting music got a new song out the last time which is a great song Ernie on guitar you think of that classic Summer Breeze that guitar solo and Ron Isley you think you think of Ron so this is going to be interesting you know how will they lay him to rest will the brothers come together then the eely Brothers family is huge and for this to come between them and Rudolph dying is really a sad thing just prayers all around to the eely brothers last night it was Beyonce and Tor Swift the ays tour is in movie theaters they say this picture going to make a $100 million I like seeing them come together paying homage to each other and I tell you why I hate when they put they pit the two against each other the swifties the beehives these two women are so dynamic in their own rights in their own lanes and they have changed how you go to concerts this movement into movies how they generate they're two superstars with an incredible fan base and they they' literally this year alone what they bought financially to the cities they came to these two women changing the course of how concerts now everybody can't do what Taylor or Beyonce did but this is amazing you make a ton of money on the road then you go to the theaters and make a ton of money and then at the beginning of the year these the arys tour the Renaissance tour they're going to be on streaming what a way to make additional money the business mind and the way that they both did it they cut out the middleman went right to I think like AMC and cut a deal a lot of people are not happy with this deal because it's like okay we see what youall doing we see the future of this and they get to keep the money they great business Minds The Ladies came together in admiration and it was good to see them cuz I was like the to me they're two different performers to put them against each other it's like both of them both of them are amazing and doing amazing things in their own way Beyonce's Renaissance hits theaters on December the 1 Britney Spear's book is coming out October 24th and everybody not happy about this book one of those not happy at all is a former boyfriend Justin Timberlake back when Britney and Justin were the eighth couple 1999 to 2002 they looked great they just seemed like they were this fun couple but then they broke up and Justin Timberlake wrote a song called crime a river was a huge hit and in the song the video there was a Britney look alike he implied that Britney cheated well now Britney is going to tell her story The Woman in me this book book comes out October 24th they say Justin Timberlake is shook he's he don't want this book to come out who knows what she's going to talk about what she talk about the real reason you know a few years when Justin said he needed to apologize to not only Britney Spears but to apologize for Janet Jackson and that nipplegate catastrophe he put a statement and he says white men are set up to succeed and everyone was scratching their heads like what's the other part of the statement but he blamed it on that what will he say they say he is Shook and we all know you know with Britney things are a little different who knows what she's going to say in this book the actor strike now you think the the riter strike was long they've walked away they walked away from the table how did they get to this was the AI stuff was it the streaming now the writers they've come together they're back at work but the actors they can't promote movies they can't and there's a lot of big stuff coming out for the fall when will the screen actor's guild come back to the table with the studios so that this strike will end I don't even know when I do to sit back down but they've both walked away from the table TJ Holmes is this close to getting divorced he's going to be a divorced man he and his wife who we married in 2010 they have a 9-year-old daughter the settlement and the divorce decree is almost almost done a lot of people said that when the affair was exposed with him and Amy robok oh let them live let them live if you're married and I stand on this you can't do the same thing that single people do not only did they cheat on their spouse but they flaunted it if you notice you don't see them flaunting it cuz they can't get a job see it may have been cute in the beginning oh we're together we're together we're together but then you can't get a job y'all going to act like y'all know each other now they are running in the New York Marathon in November but there was a backlash because people didn't look kindly to TJ you done dumped your wife you done threw away your career TJ Holmes did the best job at ABC he's worked hard all his life to throw it away Amy always said she's going to be able to get a job they're going to give her Millions she ain't taking nothing now because she desperately wants to work with TJ they either want a daytime talk show or a game show or maybe they'll do something on social media but it's got to bring in money maybe once he is divorced they can go on and be married and flaunt flaunt flaunt flaunt but I'll tell you something women don't like women if you the type they think you're going to sleep with their man maybe try to steal their man to move in on a man women don't like other women to do that TJ you'll never look good to women CU it seems like wow you discarded your family for her so there's a lot of things their PR strategy is really interesting now because they ain't doing all that FL I think because they need a job but he's this close to getting divorced as a big fan of uh the golden Bachelor I got a lot of work to do so I can't watch it I'm going watch it this week on Hulu if I thought that Miss Mr Gary was funny at 72 it's his dad that's the hoot his dad Mr Everett is 91 and he love to talk he's loving the conversation he says whoever his son picks she's going to have to know how to make a good prime rib and she's going to have to know how to cook the chick from Delaware County who is married to a baseball player in Philadelphia she know how to cook she was making me hungry talking about what she was cooking she's from my neck of the woods she's from Delaware County um Mr ever also says that his son is used to fighting over women he says back when Mr Gary was in high school he was flip-flopping between two women and his mother told him look you going to have to make a choice you can't be going back and forth with these women so he went and picking one but after his wife died in 2017 and he decided him to get back in the dating world he went looking for the girl that he dumped in high school I love Mr Gary's dad he just me talking he also said that he hopes the woman is ready to move because G Mr Gary was not leaving his home in Indiana as you see I am so totally invested in the show it's not even funny uh 7 Hunter Wendy Williams X he can't get his hands on that money so he has sold the million dooll home that he brought in Florida 1.25 million um so he's got some Millions maybe the baby mama will come back because he's not as broke cuz he's got that money but he can get his hand on Wendy's money so he's got to sell whatever he can to bring money in there weren't Lear a lot of stories obviously the big thing was Rudolph Isley dying but subscribe to the channel give us a thumbs up if you like the video leave a comment I really I mean no one knew that rudol was going to die but this and for the brothers to still have this estrangement is just very sad but we will keep you up to date on what's going on and Carly Russell the young woman with the fake kid napping hoax for the boyfriend who didn't want her she faces a year in jail she has to pay $118,000 in restitution because they wasted a lot of money in that investigation do you think she will serve any time in jail what a lesson to learn when someone does not want you it's best to move on because when someone decides they've checked out they no longer want you there's no amount of stunts there's no amount of baking there's no amount of anything to lose your dignity and lose your pride this goes for men and women if they don't want you move on it's a no and it's a blessing it's a blessing it's like a no just protection and it's a blessing and move on cuz there'll be someone else for you you thanks for joining me today I'm Patty Jackson I am your auntie of pop culture",AuZuBiHZ-Nw
