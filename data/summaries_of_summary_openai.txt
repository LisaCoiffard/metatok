In other news, it appears that Warner Bros. Discovery is considering selling the company to Universal. Warner Bros. has been struggling financially lately, with no successful movies released in the past year.

Comcast, which owns Universal, is the largest media conglomerate in the United States. If this sale happens, it could further consolidate the media industry, potentially leading to less creativity and higher prices for consumers. Quite the industry shake-up!
